This release reflects the project\'s continued momentum and commitment to modernization, usability, and stability across the KIE components: Drools, jBPM, OptaPlanner, Kogito, SonataFlow and Tools.\\n\\n## Laying Groundwork for the Future\\n\\nFollowing the foundational work in 10.0.0, this release introduces key upgrades and deprecations, improves compatibility, and continues efforts to simplify the developer and authoring experience. While not as sweeping as the prior release, 10.1.0 brings meaningful enhancements across the stack.\\n\\n### Platform Upgrades\\n\\n- Quarkus upgraded to version `3.15.3.1` (from 3.8.4)\\n- Spring Boot upgraded to version `3.4.3` (from 3.2.6) \\n\\nThese updates align with our goal of keeping KIE technologies up-to-date with modern Java ecosystems.\\n\\n### Drools\\n\\n#### Advancing Rule Units\\nRule Units remain targeted at greenfield projects and continue to evolve. These projects are better positioned to work around current limitations.\\n\\nWhile RuleUnits provide a strong foundation, there are critical gaps that must be addressed before they can be considered a complete replacement for classic DRL. Examples include ambiguity in OOPath syntax, limited support for Decision Tables, and a lack of comprehensive test coverage.\\n\\nImprovements are being investigated to simplify the use of OOPath in combination with accumulate and to improve the overall authoring experience.\\n\\n#### Rule Orchestration / startProcess\\nThe startProcess() API has been deprecated since version 8.x and should not be called from client code, as doing so will result in a RuntimeException. Although the method still exists due to internal dependencies and because it is part of a shared interface with jBPM, it is no longer functional and is expected to be removed in a future version.\\nThe recommended approach is to use the new code-generation-based process.\\n\\n\\n#### DMN 1.5 Support\\nBoth the editor and engine now support the latest **DMN 1.5** specification.\\n\\n### jBPM and Kogito\\n- Introduction of a new user task subsystem\\n- Support for transactions in compact architecture\\n- Infinispan usage is now deprecated and will be removed in the next version\\n\\n### SonataFlow Operator Enhancements\\n- Incorporates the ability to configure the SonataFlow workflows and supporting services databases using the SonataFlowPlatform.\\n- Incorporates the ability to initialize the supporting services databases using a dedicated Job, via configuration in the SonataFlowPlatForm.\\n- Incorporates the ability to produce all the events communications using the Knative Eventing System, via configuration in the SonataFlowPlatform.\\n\\n### Tooling Updates\\n- A new Test Scenario Editor with full DMN 1.5 support is now available  \\n- Classic DMN Editor and native binaries for Extended Services are both deprecated and will be removed in the next release\\n\\n## Known Limitations\\n- JIT runners are not working on **Windows** and **macOS**\\n\\n## Join the Conversation\\n\\nHave questions or want to connect with the community? We encourage all users to join the official user mailing list:\\n\\n**[users@kie.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@kie.apache.org)**  \\nThis is the best place to ask for help, share feedback, or discuss how you are using Apache KIE in your projects.\\n\\n\\n## Download\\n\\nApache KIE (Incubating) 10.1.0 is available now.

While the prolonged gap between releases posed challenges, it allowed us to focus on critical adjustments and improvements, paving the way for a stronger foundation. Here\'s an overview of the significant efforts that made this release possible:\\n\\n- Comprehensive CI system overhaul to align with Apache standards.\\n- Code adjustments for Apache policy compliance, including license reviews.\\n- Fully reproducible builds for all .jar artifacts.\\n- Remove cyclical dependencies and other technical debt.\\n- Automate critical release processes to streamline future releases.\\n- Java 17, Jakarta 10, Quarkus, and SpringBoot upgrades\\n- And many more...\\n\\n## A Leap Forward\\n\\nDespite the frustrations of a longer-than-usual release cycle, the challenges have ultimately strengthened the project. Apache KIE (Incubating) 10.0.0 is not just a new version; it represents a rebirth under the Apache umbrella, with improvements that will serve our community for years to come. The lessons learned and the investments made in this release cycle position Apache KIE (Incubating) to achieve greater velocity and innovation in the future.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWith this release, we hope to return to a predictable release cadence. Our focus is now on leveraging the enhanced foundation to deliver new features, performance improvements, and continued community-driven innovation. The journey to Apache KIE 10.0.0 has been a labor of love, and we are grateful for the support and patience of our contributors and users.\\n\\n## Download\\n\\nApache KIE (Incubating) 10.0.0 is available now.
