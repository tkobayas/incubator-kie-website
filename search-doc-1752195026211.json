These projects are better positioned to work around current limitations.  While RuleUnits provide a strong foundation, there are critical gaps that must be addressed before they can be considered a complete replacement for classic DRL. Examples include ambiguity in OOPath syntax, limited support for Decision Tables, and a lack of comprehensive test coverage.  Improvements are being investigated to simplify the use of OOPath in combination with accumulate and to improve the overall authoring experience.  Rule Orchestration / startProcess​  The startProcess() API has been deprecated since version 8.x and should not be called from client code, as doing so will result in a RuntimeException. Although the method still exists due to internal dependencies and because it is part of a shared interface with jBPM, it is no longer functional and is expected to be removed in a future version. The recommended approach is to use the new code-generation-based process.  DMN 1.5 Support​  Both the editor and engine now support the latest DMN 1.5 specification.

To be effective, that language must be both usable by business analysts and stakeholders in the business and verifiable for completeness and consistency. DMN is both. — Bruce Silver, What is DMN?    Manage any decision complexity by decomposing and structuring decision services with Decision Requirement Graph (DRG).    Model business logic with DMN Decision Table, an effective instrument understandable by all personas. Drools DMN engine performs static analysis of the DMN Decision Table to detect gaps, overlaps, and ensure the table rules follow industry best practices.    Model more complex business logic with the power of all the FEEL Boxed Expression constructs made available by the DMN Standard specification.  Integrate DMN with BPMN and CMMN to describe an executable and semantically defined business logic to be used in business processes.      Drools DMN engine provides full runtime support for DMN models at Conformance level 3, meaning 100% of the features in the Standard.  We contribute to the DMN Technology Compatibility Kit (DMN TCK), a community-led proposal for a verifiable and executable method to demonstrate the Conformance level of support provided by a vendor-supplied DMN implementation.

Capabilities can be (among others):  persistencemessagingtransactionsbusiness processes, business rulesplanning solutions  Business application is more of a logical grouping of individual services that represent certain business capabilities. Usually they are deployed separately and can also be versioned individually. Overall goal is that the complete business application will allow particular domain to achieve their business goals e.g. order management, accommodation management, etc. Business application is  Build on any runtimeDeployable to cloud with just single commandUI agnostic (doesn’t enforce any UI frameworks and let users to make their own choice)Configurable database profilesGenerated  Business application consists of (though are not restricted to have only one of each project types)  data model project - shared data model between business assets and servicebusiness assets (kjar) project - easily importable into workbenchservice project - actual service with various capabilities  Service project is the one that is deployable but will in most of the cases include business assets and data model projects.  Data model project represents the common data structures that will be shared between service implementation and business assets. That enables proper encapsulation and promotes reuse and at the same time reduces shortcuts to make data model classes something more than they are - include too much of implementation into data models.  Business assets project represents your business logic as processes, cases, rules, decision tables and more.  Following are the maven archetype commands need to be used to generate different types of projects:  Data model archetype mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-model-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.74.1.Final -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-model -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.model   This command creates a project which generates business-application-model-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  Business assets project archetype mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.74.1.Final -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company   This command creates a project which generates business-application-kjar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  Dynamic assets project archetype mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.74.1.Final -DcaseProject=true -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-kjar -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company   This command creates a project which generates business-application-kjar-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  Service project archetype can be used based on the capabilities that are needed in the project. Capabilities essentially define the features that your business application will be equipped with. Available options are:  Business automation(bpm) covers features for process management, case management, decision management and optimization. These will be by default configured in the service project of your business application. Although you can turn them off via configuration. mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.74.1.Final -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=bpm Decision management(brm) covers mainly decision and rules related features (backed by Drools project) mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.74.1.Final -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=brm Business optimization(planner) covers planning problems and solutions related features (backed by OptaPlanner project) mvn archetype:generate -B -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-service-spring-boot-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.74.1.Final -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=business-application-service -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=com.company.service -DappType=planner   These commands create a project which generates business-application-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Build your first Business Application​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Business Applications - Getting Started","url":"/docs/components/jbpm/getting_started/#build-your-first-business-application","content":" To build your first business application,use the above mentioned maven archetype commands to generate a Data project,Business assets project and a Service project with desired capabilities.

A business application could be defined as a domain-specific solution (built with selected frameworks and capabilities) that solves a particular business problem. To implement the business logic it leverages capabilities from various frameworks like business processes, business rules and planning constraints, but also persistence, messaging, transactions, etc.  jBPM is open source software, released under the Apache License 2.0.

This greatly improves the visibility and agility of your business logic, results in higher-level and domain-specific representations that can be understood by business users and is easier to monitor.  The core of jBPM is a light-weight, extensible workflow engine written in pure Java that allows you to execute business processes using the latest BPMN 2.0 specification. It can run in any Java environment, embedded in your application or as a service.  On top of the core engine, a lot of features and tools are offered to support business processes throughout their entire life cycle:  Eclipse-based and web-based editor to support the graphical creation of your business processes and case definitions (drag &amp; drop).Pluggable persistence and transactions based on JPA / JTA.Pluggable human task service based on WS-HumanTask for including tasks that need to be performed by human actors.Management console supporting process instance management, task lists and task form management, and reporting.Optional process repository to deploy your process (and other related knowledge).History logging (for querying / monitoring / analysis).Integration with various frameworks such as CDI/EJB, Spring(Boot), OSGi, etc.  BPM makes the bridge between business analysts, developers and end users, by offering process management features and tools in a way that both business users and developers like it. Domain-specific nodes can be plugged into the palette, making the processes more easily understood by business users.  jBPM supports adaptive and dynamic processes that require flexibility to model complex, real-life situations that cannot easily be described using a rigid process. We bring control back to the end users by allowing them to control which parts of the process should be executed, to dynamically deviate from the process, etc.  jBPM is also not just an isolated process engine. Complex business logic can be modeled as a combination of business processes with business rules and complex event processing. jBPM can be combined with the Drools project to support one unified environment that integrates these paradigms where you model your business logic as a combination of processes, rules and events.
