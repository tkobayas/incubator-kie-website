# Documentation

Apache KIE (incubating) provides live documentation for community in two streams.

1. Development stream - built & published nightly from `main` branch. Usage is limited to testing and development. 
2. Release stream - built & published after the vote on release canidates passes. We will maintain each released branch until it is deprecated.
