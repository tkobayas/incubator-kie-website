In the approach outlined in this guide, protect your workflows from anonymous access outside the cluster with the OpenID Connect specification. Although the example demonstrated in this document is not meant to be used in production, you can use it as a reference to create your own architecture. The following image illustrates a simplified architecture view of the recommended approach for protecting SonataFlow workflow endpoints. User makes a request with their credentials APISIX do the JWT token introspection in the OIDC Server (Keycloak) Keycloak validates the token APISIX forwards the request to the workflow application This is a simplified approach for OIDC (OpenID Connect protocol) use cases. In production environments, you can tailor your gateway and OIDC server to meet your requirements and scope. This approach only protects the communication via Ingress. Direct calls to the workflow application internal service would be anonymous. For example, another microservice in the cluster making requests to the workflow internal service. Set Kuberbetes NetworkPolicies to your workflow applications if this is not the desired behavior. The following sections describe how to deploy the example architecture using APISIX and Keycloak to protect your SonataFlow workflows. Prerequisites Minikube is installed. You can use Kind or any other cluster if you have admin access. Just ensure to adapt the steps below to your environment. Clone the example SonataFlow APISIX with Keycloak in a local directory. (Optional) SonataFlow Operator is installed if you are going to deploy via the operator. (Optional) Quarkus SonataFlow workflow is deployed if you are not using the operator. From the example’s cloned directory 'sonataflow-apisix-oidc', run the following command: Running kustomize to install Keycloak kubectl create ns keycloak kubectl kustomize manifests/bases | kubectl apply -f - -n keycloak This command creates a namespace called keycloak and a Keycloak server deployment connected to a PostgreSQL database to persist your data across cluster restarts. You can skip this section if you are running on OpenShift or any cluster that you can expose Keycloak via an Ingress DNS or Route. Since Keycloak is running on Minikube, expose the service port to your local network by running the following command: Exposing Keycloak to the local network kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods -l app=keycloak --output=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' -n keycloak) 8080:8080 -n keycloak From now on, every connection to the 8080 port is forwarded to the Keycloak service endpoint. The next step is to configure your local /etc/hosts. This step is needed because the token you are going to generate must come from the same URL that the APISIX server introspects once you access the workflow. Edit your local /etc/hosts file and add the following line: Hosts file with the Keycloak address entry 127.0.0.1 keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local You can try accessing your Keycloak admin console in the address http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080. The default user and password are admin. In real-life environments, this step is not needed since Keycloak or any OIDC server is served by a load balancer with the correct address configured. In the next step, log in to the Keycloak admin console in the address http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080 using the default credentials. Once you are logged into the console, click Create realm in the top left menu. In this screen, create a new realm named sonataflow. See the image below for more details: Figure 1. Creation of the new sonataflow realm Next, create a client for the APISIX Ingress to introspect the JWT tokens. In the left menu, make sure that you are in the sonataflow realm and click on Clients, then Create client. Give the name apisix-ingress and then click on Next. Figure 2. Creation of the APISIX Ingress client Next, add the details about this client: Turn the Client authentication option on. Leave Authorization off. Mark the options Standard flow and Direct access grants and leave the rest blank. Figure 3. APISIX Ingress client details Click on Next, leave everything blank in the next screen and click on Save. In this example, create a user registered in the Keycloak server to access the workflow application. For simplicity, use the Grant Type Resource Owner Password. This flow is not recommended for production architectures. Consider using other mechanisms such as Authorization Code or Client Credentials. In the left menu, make sure that you are in the sonataflow realm and click on Users and then click Create new user. In this screen, fill in the details according to the figure below: Switch Email verified option on. Set Username to luke. Set Email to luke@republic.org Set First name to Luke and Last name to Skywalker Figure 4. Creating a workflow user Click on Create. Next, set the credentials for this newly created user. Click on Users in the left menu and then in the name luke. In this screen, click on the tab Credentials, and then on Set password. Figure 5. Setting user’s password Set the password as luke (same as the username), leave the Temporary option off and click on Save. Use the credentials luke/luke later in this guide to acquire a JWT token to make requests to the workflow application. Follow the documentation on APISIX Documentation website and install the APISIX Ingress in your cluster (install the HELM client first). If you are running on Minikube, expose the APISIX Ingress server: Exposing apisix-ingress service to the local network minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix The command outcome is the local URL which you can access the Ingress you create later in this guide. Leave the terminal open. If you are not running on Minikube, see the APISIX Ingress documentation for more information on how to expose the Ingress already in your cluster. After this step, Keycloak OIDC Server and APISIX Ingress Controller on your cluster are able to protect your SonataFlow workflow applications from external requests. In this section, learn how to deploy the Greeting workflow example and a custom APIXSIX Ingress to protect external requests to the application’s endpoints. Prerequisites You installed, configured, and exposed the Keycloak server You installed and exposed the APISIX Ingress server You installed the SonataFlow Operator You cloned the example application locally The first step is to deploy the SonataFlow workflow. Enter the example project directory that you cloned locally and run the command below: Deploying the Greeting workflow kubectl create ns sonataflow kubectl apply -f workflow-app/01-sonataflow-greeting.yaml -n sonataflow You can follow the workflow deployment by running Follow the workflow deployment process kubectl -n sonataflow get workflow/greeting -w NAME PROFILE VERSION URL READY REASON greeting 0.0.1 False WaitingForBuild Once you deploy the SonataFlow workflow you can configure and deploy the APISIX Route. Open the file workflow-app/02-sonataflow-route.yaml in the example application you cloned earlier and change the credentials for the apisix-ingress client that you created in the Keycloak server: Greeting workflow APISIX Route apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v2 kind: ApisixRoute metadata: name: sonataflow spec: http: - name: greeting match: hosts: - local.greeting.sonataflow.org paths: - \"/*\" backends: - serviceName: greeting servicePort: 80 plugins: - name: openid-connect (1) enable: true config: client_id: apisix-ingress client_secret: (2) discovery: http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/sonataflow/.well-known/openid-configuration scope: profile email bearer_only: true realm: sonataflow introspection_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post 1 The OpenID Connect plugin to make the Ingress connect to Keycloak 2 The apisix-ingress client credential to be changed Open the Keycloak server (http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080) and in the realm sonataflow click on Clients, and then on apisix-ingress. Click on the tab Credentials and copy the Client Secret: Figure 6. Creating the workflow user Paste the Client Secret into the ApisixRoute file workflow-app/02-sonataflow-route.yaml in the example application and run: Deploy the ApisixRoute kubectl apply -f workflow-app/02-sonataflow-route.yaml -n sonataflow To this point, you have installed in your cluster the Keycloak and APISIX Ingress server, and deployed the example Greeting workflow application. Access the workflow without a token to see a rejection: Directly accessing the workflow without a token INGRESS_URL= (1) curl -v POST ${INGRESS_URL}/greeting -H \"Content-type: application/json\" -H \"Host: local.greeting.sonataflow.org\" --data '{ \"name\": \"Luke\" }' 1 The ingress url is accessible via the Minikube service command. If you have not done it already, run minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix. See a 401 HTTP Status message denying your access to the workflow. Next, access the application using an access token. First, you need to get the access token from the Keycloak server: Requesting an access token to Keycloak server CLIENT_SECRET=\"secret from apisix-ingress client\" (1) ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl \\ -d \"client_id=apisix-ingress\" \\ -d \"client_secret=${CLIENT_SECRET}\" \\ -d \"username=luke\" \\ -d \"password=luke\" \\ -d \"grant_type=password\" \\ \"http://keycloak.keycloak.svc.cluster.local:8080/realms/sonataflow/protocol/openid-connect/token\" | jq -r .access_token) (2) 1 Copy the secret from the apisix-ingress client 2 Request an access token from the Keycloak server using the user luke credentials The token returned with the command above has a default timeout of 5 minutes, which means that if you take too long to use it, or want to execute several requests, you might need to execute the command again and get a new token. Having the access token set in an environment variable, access the application again: INGRESS_URL= (1) curl -v POST ${INGRESS_URL}/greeting -H \"Content-type: application/json\" -H \"Host: local.greeting.sonataflow.org\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}\" --data '{ \"name\": \"Luke\" }' 1 The ingress url is accessible via the Minikube service command. If you have not done it already, run minikube service apisix-gateway --url -n ingress-apisix. This request is passing through the APISIX Gateway, which is validating the token via the Authorization: Bearer header. Then the request is passed internally to the workflow application which process and return to the original client. Finally, this time, in the last part of the command output, you should see a JSON document similar to the excerpt below, which indicates that the workflow instance was created successfully. {\"id\":\"a9fc1a97-e274-4e40-80e5-4ff5ba203231\",\"workflowdata\":{\"message\":\"Hello from YAML Workflow, anonymous\"}} In this guide you were able to deploy an architecture of services capable of authenticating a valid user using OIDC mechanisms. Now, everytime that someone needs access to the deployed workflow, it must first get a valid JWT token in the Keycloak OIDC Server. Next steps now, would be to tailor this architecture for your needs such as a cluster of Keycloak servers behind a TLS and valid domain. Also, APISIX Ingress offers many other capabilities and configurations that can be tuned to favor your use cases.

It allows users to initiate workflows, trigger Cloud Events, and monitor their execution. Prerequisites Your SonataFlow application is deployed and ready to use. A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster with admin privileges and kubectl installed. (Optional) Keycloak server is installed. The SonataFlow Management Console relies on the underlying services of the SonataFlow application, including the Data Index service. The Data Index provides data from workflow executions, enabling the Management Console to display workflow information. Ensure that your Data Index service is deployed and accessible before deploying the Management Console. See also: Deploying your SonataFlow application on OpenShift Data Index installation with the Operator If you already have Keycloak deployment or server available you can skip this section. For production environments, deploy Keycloak to handle authentication or choose your own OAuth2 server. You can refer to the SonataFlow Keycloak documentation here. Create the deployment for the SonataFlow Management Console by applying the following YAML definition: Example configuration in sonataflow-management-console-deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: sonataflow-management-console spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: sonataflow-management-console template: metadata: labels: app: sonataflow-management-console spec: containers: - name: sonataflow-management-console image: apache/incubator-kie-sonataflow-management-console:latest imagePullPolicy: Always ports: - containerPort: 8080 name: http protocol: TCP env: - name: SONATAFLOW_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_KOGITO_ENV_MODE value: DEV (1) - name: SONATAFLOW_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_DATA_INDEX_ENDPOINT value: publicly.accesible.url.of.data-index-service/graphql (2) 1 (Optional) Environment mode: \"PROD\" or \"DEV\".

Finally, expose the service with a route, so that it can be accessed externally. Create the route by applying the following YAML: Example configuration in sonataflow-management-console-route.yaml apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 kind: Route metadata: name: sonataflow-management-console-route spec: to: kind: Service name: sonataflow-management-console-service port: targetPort: http Apply SonataFlow Management Console Route kubectl apply -f sonataflow-management-console-route.yaml For Kubernetes you can expose the SonataFlow Management Console using an Ingress. To create an Ingress, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation here: Kubernetes Ingress Guide. In a production environment, you can integrate the SonataFlow Management Console with a Keycloak server for authentication or any OAuth2 server. Set the following environment variables in your deployment: SONATAFLOW_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_DATA_INDEX_ENDPOINT=\"PROD\" KOGITO_CONSOLES_KEYCLOAK_HEALTH_CHECK_URL – The Keycloak realm’s health check URL.

This means that a Parallel State does not create one thread per branch, simulating an actual parallel behavior. If an exclusive property is set to false, you should not use the Event State of the workflow states feature as the starting state. In case that it is specified that way, it will behave as if an exclusive property was set to true. SonataFlow does not support the Sleep State feature. However, this feature will be supported in a future release. The following table shows the implementation status in SonataFlow of workflow states of the Serverless Workflow specification 0.8 version: Table 3.

For more information about these custom function types, see Custom functions for your SonataFlow service. SonataFlow supports events of the workflow model as defined in the Serverless Workflow specification definition, except the following: resultEventRef property in EventRefDefinition is not implemented and, if specified, this property is ignored. The same functionality can be achieved by using Callback state. Correlation has limited support, that evaluates correlation rules matching a single event consumed per time with a workflow instance. The correlation among N different events to be consumed and matched with a workflow instance is not supported in SonataFlow. For more information about event correlation, see Event correlation in SonataFlow. SonataFlow supports the implementation of the data manipulation feature using jq (default) or jsonpath expressions. jsonpath expressions can have limitations in specific scenarios of complex data manipulation. For more information, see Workflow Data section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. SonataFlow also supports data filtering. For more information about the data filtering, see State data filters section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. SonataFlow supports jq or jsonpath to define the workflow expressions. jq is the default expression language, however, if you want to use jsonpath, set the expressionLang attribute in the workflow definition as shown in the following example: Example of changing the default expression language { \"id\": \"myworkflow\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"expressionLang\": \"jsonpath\", \"name\": \"Workflow example\", \"description\": \"An example of how to use jsonpath expressions\" } jsonpath expression is not recommended because of the limitations of the language for data manipulation. Instead, you can use jq in various use cases. SonataFlow supports the error handling feature as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about error handling, see Error handling in SonataFlow. SonataFlow does not support Retries feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Alternatively, you can use Error handling in SonataFlow. SonataFlow has limited support for the timeouts feature, covering only workflow and event timeouts. For start event state the exclusive property is not supported if set to false, therefore the timeout is not supported for the event state when starting a workflow. For more information about timeouts, see Timeouts on events for SonataFlow. SonataFlow supports workflow compensation as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about compensations, see Saga orchestration example in SonataFlow. SonataFlow supports workflow constants as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. SonataFlow supports workflow secrets as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Secrets are associated with the Quarkus Configuration module. This means that any form of configuration that Quarkus supports is also supported in SonataFlow.

SonataFlow supports several custom types, which are listed below. Custom functions might not be portable across other implementations. You can use the sysout function for logging as shown in the following example: Example of sysout function definition { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"logInfo\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"sysout:INFO\" } ] } The string after the : is optional and is used to indicate the log level. The possible values are TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR. If not present, INFO is considered by default. In the state definition, you can call the same sysout function as shown in the following example: Example of a sysout function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"logInfo\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"\\\"Workflow model is \\\\(.)\\\"\" } } } ] } ] } message argument can be a jq expression or a jq string using interpolation, as in the example above SonataFlow supports the java functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your workflow service. The following example shows the declaration of a java function: Example of a java function declaration { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myFunction\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod\" (3) } ] } 1 myFunction is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod is the custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition, service is the reserved operation keyword followed by the java keyword. com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass is the FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) of the interface or implementation class followed by the method name (myMethod). Your method interface signature must copy the arguments passed by the workflow. For example, if you invoke a function using one argument as follows, then your method signature assumes that the number model variable is an integer: Example of a java function reference with one argument { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"number\": \"${.number}\" } } } Example of a java function implementation public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public void myMethod(int number) { if (number % 2 != 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Odd situation\"); } } } As a particular case, if you provide no argument in the workflow definition, the signature of the Java method might include a Jackson’s JsonNode parameter. This means that the Java method expects the entire workflow model as input. When using the following example function reference with no arguments, and if the method signature contains a JsonNode parameter, the entire workflow model is passed when the method call is performed. Example of a java function reference with no arguments { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\" } } Example of a java function implementation public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the Workflow model ...... // return the modified content: return workflowData; } } If your method returns a JsonNode, the content of that node is merged into the workflow model (you can use an action data filter to control what is merged). The same occurs if your method returns any Java Object descendant that is not a primitive wrapper, the Java object is recursively converted to a JSON object and the result is merged into the workflow model (you can use an action data filter to control what is merged). If your method returns a primitive type or their corresponding wrapper object (int, boolean, long, and so on), then the primitive value is added to the workflow model with the name response (you can change that name using an action data filter). If your method returns Java collections, it is converted to a JSON array and added to the workflow model with the name response (you can change that name using an action data filter). If you need access to process contextual information (for example, Kogito process instance ID) inside your Java service, you can add a KogitoProcessContext parameter as the last one in the method signature. Therefore, if you need to do so, you can update the signature of methods from previous sections. Example of a function accessing Kogito context public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData, KogitoProcessContext context ) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode and the Kogito process context ...... // return the modified content: return workflowData; } } Example of a function accessing Kogito context public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public void myMethod(int number, KogitoProcessContext context) { if (number % 2 != 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Odd situation\"); } } } Avoid using java functions to call the external services, instead, you can use the services orchestration features. Kogito supports the Camel Routes functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your workflow service. This section briefly exemplifies how to define and use Camel Routes within your workflow application. For more information, see the Integrating with Camel Routes. The following example shows the declaration of a Camel function: { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myCamelEndpoint\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"camel:direct:myendpoint\" (3) } ] } 1 myCamelEndpoint is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 camel:direct:myendpoint is the custom operation definition. In this definition, camel is the reserved keyword followed by the direct endpoint. Camel Direct is the only supported consumer by SonataFlow. Finally, myendpoint is the endpoint URI name found in the route within your project’s context. The Camel function arguments must follow a specific structure when passing data from the workflow state to the route. The body and headers are the only attributes supported in the function arguments. Both are optional if you need to call the Camel routes without arguments. The only constraint is that you can not call a Camel route with only headers. The following examples display valid argument structures for Camel function arguments: Example calling a Camel route using body and headers { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myCamelEndpoint\", \"arguments\": { \"body\": \"${ .my.body.data }\", (1) \"headers\": { (2) \"key1\": \"${ .my.value }\", \"key2\": \"${ .my.other.value }\" } } } } 1 jq expression filtering the state data for the body argument. 2 JSON key/value pair for the headers argument. A jq expression returning the same JSON object is also valid. Example calling a Camel route using body { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myCamelEndpoint\", \"arguments\": { \"body\": \"${ .my.body.data }\" } } } Example calling a Camel route without arguments { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myCamelEndpoint\" } } Example calling a Camel route with only one argument { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myCamelEndpoint\", \"arguments\": \"${ .my.body.data }\" } } In this last example, the jq expression result is used as the body argument in a way to simplify the definition. The Camel route is responsible to produce the return value in a way that the workflow can understand. The following are considered valid objects: A string that contains a valid JSON object A valid Java bean that can be serialized to JSON A Jackson’s JsonNode object Any primitive type (Integer, Float, Decimal, String, etc) SonataFlow implements a custom function to execute embedded Python scripts and functions. See Invoking Python from SonataFlow SonataFlow provides an implementation of a custom function through the knative-serving add-on to invoke Knative services. It allows you to have a static URI, defining a Knative service, which is used to perform HTTP requests. The Knative service defined in the URI is queried in the current Knative cluster and translated to a valid URL. This section briefly exemplifies how to define and use Knative custom functions within your workflow application. For more information, see Invoking Knative services from Serverless Workflow. Given the following deployed Knative service: $ kn service list NAME URL LATEST AGE CONDITIONS READY REASON custom-function-knative-service http://custom-function-knative-service.default.10.109.169.193.sslip.io custom-function-knative-service-00001 3h16m 3 OK / 3 True You can declare a SonataFlow custom function using the Knative service name, like the following: \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"greet\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/custom-function-knative-service?path=/plainJsonFunction\", (3) } ] 1 greet is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 In operation you set the coordinates of the Knative service. See Kubernetes Service Discovery for supported Scheme and Kubernetes GVK The above function will send a POST request to the http://custom-function-knative-service.default.10.109.169.193.sslip.io/plainJsonFunction URL. If you don’t specify a path, SonataFlow will use the root path (/). You can also send GET requests by setting method=GET in operation. In this case, the arguments are forwarded over a query string. Example of a GET request \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"greet\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/custom-function-knative-service?path=/plainJsonFunction&method=GET\", (1) } ] 1 GET request Note that in the above example, you declared only the name of the service you wanted to call, but not a namespace. In this case, SonataFlow will look for a Knative service in the same namespace the workflow service is running. In case you need to call a Knative service in a different namespace, you can declare the function as: \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"greet\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/my_different_namespace/custom-function-knative-service?path=/plainJsonFunction\" } ] In the above example, SonataFlow will look for the custom-function-knative-service in the my_different_namespace namespace. In case you need to send a payload in the request, you can add it to arguments in functionRef. You must send the following JSON object as the payload: { \"product_id\": \".product_id\", \"customer_name\": \".customer_name\" } You must declare a functionRef like the following. \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"invokeFunction\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"greet\", \"arguments\": { (1) \"product_id\": \".product_id\", \"customer_name\": \".customer_name\" } } } ], \"end\": true } ] 1 The request payload is set in arguments. By default, SonataFlow sends the payload of a Knative function as a regular JSON object and Content-Type as application/json. However, you can tell SonataFlow to send the payload as a CloudEvent. In that case, SonataFlow will check if the CloudEvent has all mandatory attributes set and use application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8 in Content-Type. To tell SonataFlow you want to send the payload as a CloudEvent, you must define your function as follows: \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"greet\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/custom-function-knative-service?path=/plainJsonFunction&asCloudEvent=true\" (1) } ] 1 Tells SonataFlow to send the payload as a CloudEvent. Default is false If you do not set the asCloudEvent attribute to true, you can not send a CloudEvent. If you do so, SonataFlow will throw an error. You must send the following CloudEvent as the payload: { \"specversion\" : \"1.0\", \"type\" : \"com.github.pull_request.opened\", \"source\" : \"https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull\", \"subject\" : \"123\", \"time\" : \"2018-04-05T17:31:00Z\", \"comexampleextension1\" : \"value\", \"comexampleothervalue\" : 5, \"datacontenttype\" : \"text/xml\", \"data\" : \"\" } You must declare a functionRef like the following: (Do not forget to set asCloudEvent as true in function metadata) \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"invokeFunction\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"greet\", \"arguments\": { (1) \"specversion\" : \"1.0\", \"type\" : \"com.github.pull_request.opened\", \"source\" : \"https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull\", \"subject\" : \"123\", \"time\" : \"2018-04-05T17:31:00Z\", \"comexampleextension1\" : \"value\", \"comexampleothervalue\" : 5, \"datacontenttype\" : \"text/xml\", \"data\" : \"\" } } } ], \"end\": true } ] 1 The CloudEvent is set in arguments. SonataFlow generates a CloudEvent ID based on the source and the workflow instance ID. In case you decide to set an ID, SonataFlow will use it and you must ensure it’s unique. Refer to the following example on how to set a CloudEvent ID: Setting a CloudEvent ID \"arguments\": { \"specversion\" : \"1.0\", \"id\": \"a_unique_id_42\", (1) \"type\" : \"com.github.pull_request.opened\", \"source\" : \"https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull\", \"subject\" : \"123\", \"time\" : \"2018-04-05T17:31:00Z\", \"comexampleextension1\" : \"value\", \"comexampleothervalue\" : 5, \"datacontenttype\" : \"text/xml\", \"data\" : \"\" } 1 The CloudEvent ID. By default, the Knative service must respond within 10 seconds. You can use the kogito.sw.functions..timeout property to configure this value. For instance, if you want to reduce the request timeout to 5 seconds, you must add the following to your application.properties file: kogito.sw.functions.greet.timeout=5000 (1) 1 Time in milliseconds Serverless Workflow Specification defines the OpenAPI function type, which is the preferred way to interact with existing REST servers. However, sometimes a workflow should interact with several REST APIs that are not described using an OpenAPI specification file. Since generating such files for these services might be tedious, SonataFlow offers REST custom type as a shortcut. When using custom rest, in the function definition, you specify the HTTP URI to be invoked and the HTTP method (get, post, patch, or put) to be used, using the operation string. When the function is invoked, you pass the request arguments as you do when using an OpenAPI function. The following example shows the declaration of a rest function: Example of a rest function declaration { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"multiplyAllByAndSum\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"rest:post:/numbers/{multiplier}/multiplyByAndSum\" (3) } ] } 1 multiplyAllAndSum is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 rest:post:/numbers/{multiplier}/multiplyByAndSum is the custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition: rest is the reserved operation keyword that indicates this is a REST call. post is the HTTP method. /numbers/{multiplier}/multiplyByAndSum is the relative endpoint. When using the relative endpoints you must specify the host as a property. The format of the host property is kogito.sw.functions..host. Therefore, in this example, kogito.sw.functions.multiplyAllByAndSum.host is the host property key. You might override the default port (80) if needed by specifying kogito.sw.functions.multiplyAllAndSum.port property. This particular endpoint expects as body a JSON object whose field numbers is an array of integers, multiplies each item in the array by multiplier and returns the sum of all the multiplied items. Therefore, to invoke it, assuming the input array is stored in the workflow model as property inputNumbers, you should write: Example of a rest function call { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"multiplyAllByAndSum\", \"arguments\": { \"numbers\": \"$.inputNumbers\" \"multiplier\": 3 (1) } } } 1 you replace path and query parameters by specifying an argument which name is equal to the path or query parameter. The query or path parameter to be replaced should be enclosed within {} in the endpoint string. If inputNumbers contains 1, 2, and 3, the output of the call will be `1*3+2*3+3*3=18. In case you want to specify headers in your HTTP request, you might do it by adding arguments starting with the HEADER_ prefix. Therefore, if you add \"HEADER_ce_id\": \"123\" to the previous argument set, you will be adding a header named ce_id with the value 123 to your request. A similar approach might be used to add query params to a GET request, in that case, you must add arguments starting with the QUERY_ prefix. Note that you can also use {} notation for replacements of query parameters included directly in the operation string. For example, given the following function definition that performs a get request Example of a get request definition { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"getProductList\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"rest:get:/products/search?category={category}\" } ] } You can replace {category} specifying an argument with that name, plus adding sort query parameter Example of a get request invocation { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"getProductList\", \"arguments\": { \"category\": \"electronics\", \"QUERY_sort\": \"asc\" } } } You can add your custom types by using the Kogito add-on mechanism. As predefined custom types like sysout or java, the custom type identifier is the prefix of the operation field of the function definition. Kogito add-ons relies on the Quarkus extensions mechanism. And the add-on consists of at least two Maven projects: The deployment module, which is responsible for generating the code required for the extension to work. The runtime module, which includes the non-generated classes that are required for the extension to work. In the case of a Serverless Workflow custom type, following are the roles of the modules: The deployment project The deployment project is expected to configure the work item handler used during runtime to perform the logic associated with the custom type. It must contain a Java class that inherits from WorkItemTypeHandler. Its responsibilities are to indicate the custom type identifier (the operation prefix, as indicated earlier) and to set up the WorkItemNodeFactory instance passed as a parameter of the fillWorkItemHandler method. That instance is included in the Kogito process definition for that Workflow. As a part of this setup, you must indicate the name of the WorkItemNodeFactory. You might also provide any relevant metadata for that handler if needed. The runtime project The runtime project consists of a WorkflowWorkItemHandler implementation, which name must match with the one provided to WorkItemNodeFactory during the deployment phase, and a WorkItemHandlerConfig bean that registers that handler with that name. When a Serverless Workflow function is called, Kogito identifies the proper WorkflowWorkItemHandler instance to be used for that function type (using the handler name associated with that type by the deployment project) and then invokes the internalExecute method. The Map parameter contains the function arguments defined in the workflow, and the WorkItem parameter contains the metadata information added to the handler by the deployment project. Hence, the executeWorkItem implementation has access to all the information needed to perform the computational logic intended for that custom type. Assuming you want to interact, from a workflow file, with a legacy RPC server as the one defined in this project. This legacy server supports four simple arithmetic operations: add, minus, multiply and divide, which can be invoked using a custom RPC protocol. Since this is an uncommon protocol, the workflow cannot handle them by using any of the predefined Serverless Workflow function types. The available options are to use a Java service, which invokes a Java class that knows how to interact with the server, or define a custom type that knows how to interact with the service. Using the recent approach, you can write a workflow file defining this function. RPC Custom function definition example \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"division\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"rpc:division\" } ], The operation starts with rpc, which is the custom type identifier, and continues with division, which denotes the operation that will be executed in the legacy server. A Kogito addon that defines the rpc custom type must be developed for this function definition to be identified. It is consist of a deployment project and a runtime project. The deployment project is responsible for extending the WorkItemTypeHandler and setup of the WorkItemNodeFactory as follows: Example of the RPC function Java implementation import static org.kie.kogito.examples.sw.custom.RPCCustomWorkItemHandler.NAME; import static org.kie.kogito.examples.sw.custom.RPCCustomWorkItemHandler.OPERATION; public class RPCCustomTypeHandler extends WorkItemTypeHandler{ @Override public String type() { return \"rpc\"; } @Override protected > WorkItemNodeFactory fillWorkItemHandler(Workflow workflow, ParserContext context, WorkItemNodeFactory node, FunctionDefinition functionDef) { return node.workName(NAME).metaData(OPERATION, trimCustomOperation(functionDef)); } } This example setups the name of the KogitoWorkItemHandler, adds a metadata key with the name of the remote operation (extracted from the Serverless Workflow function definition operation property), and declares that the custom type is named as rpc. The Runtime project contains the KogitoWorkItemHandler and the WorkItemHandlerConfig implementations. As expected, RPCCustomWorkItemHandler implements the internalExecute method as follows: Example of implementation of the internalExecute method @Override protected Object internalExecute(KogitoWorkItem workItem, Map parameters) { try { Iterator iter = parameters.values().iterator(); Map metadata = workItem.getNodeInstance().getNode().getMetaData(); String operationId = (String) metadata.get(OPERATION); if (operationId == null) { throw new IllegalArgumentException (\"Operation is a mandatory parameter\"); } return CalculatorClient.invokeOperation((String)metadata.getOrDefault(HOST,\"localhost\"), (int) metadata.getOrDefault(PORT, 8082), OperationId.valueOf(operationId.toUpperCase()), (Integer)iter.next(), (Integer)iter.next()); } catch (IOException io ) { throw new UncheckedIOException(io); } } The implementation invokes the CalculatorClient.invokeOperation, a java static method that knows how to interact with the legacy service. You can obtain the operation parameter from the WorkItem metadata. The dividend and the divisor parameters are obtained from the Map parameter, which contains the function arguments defined in the workflow file. Example of the custom function call from the workflow definition { \"actions\":[ { \"functionRef\":{ \"refName\":\"division\", \"arguments\":{ \"dividend\":\".dividend\", \"divisor\":\".divisor\" } } } ] } The RPCCustomWorkItemHandlerConfig is a bean that registers the handler name. Example of injecting the custom`WorkItemHandler` @Inject RPCCustomWorkItemHandler handler; @PostConstruct void init () { register(handler.getName(),handler); } CNCF Serverless Workflow specification jq expressions in SonataFlow If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

The dataInputSchema parameter validates the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema. It is important to provide dataInputSchema, as it is used to verify if the provided workflow data input is correct before any workflow states are executed. You can define a dataInputSchema as follows: dataInputSchema definition \"dataInputSchema\": { \"schema\": \"URL_to_json_schema\", \"failOnValidationErrors\": false } In the previous definition, the schema property is a URI, which holds the path to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input. The URI can be a classpath URI, a file, or an HTTP URL. If a classpath URI is specified, then the JSON schema file must be placed in the resources section of the project or any other directory included in the classpath. failOnValidationErrors is an optional flag that indicates the behavior adopted when the input data does not match the specified JSON schema. If not specified or set to true, an exception will be thrown and flow execution will fail. If set to false, the flow will be executed and a log of level WARN with the validation errors will be printed. Serverless Workflow specification does not support JSON output schema until version 0.9. Therefore, SonataFlow is implementing it as a Serverless Workflow specification extension. Output schema is applied after workflow execution to verify that the output model has the expected format. It is also useful for Swagger generation purposes. Similar to Input schema, you must specify the URL to the JSON schema, using outputSchema as follows: outputSchema definition \"extensions\" : [ { \"extensionid\": \"workflow-output-schema\", \"outputSchema\": { \"schema\" : \"URL_to_json_schema\", \"failOnValidationErrors\": false } } ] The same rules described for dataInputSchema apply for schema and failOnValidationErrors. The difference is that the latter flag is applied after workflow execution. You can see the serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application of a workflow definition with dataInputSchema and outputSchema. When a workflow definition contains a dataInputSchema and/or outputSchema attribute, the workflow application generates an OpenAPI file, such as http://localhost:8080/q/openapi. The generated OpenAPI file references the schema file, which helps in defining the input and checking the output data for the workflows. For more information about the OpenAPI file, see OpenAPI specification. If you want to generate an OpenAPI file for a workflow, then you must add the Quarkus dependency in the project.

You can use the event state to start a new workflow instance upon the reception of a designated CloudEvent or to pause the execution of an existing workflow instance until a designated CloudEvent is received. An event state consists of one or more event definitions. Event definitions are combined to designate the CloudEvent types that the event state listens to. In an event definition, the onEvents property is used to group the CloudEvent types that might trigger the same set of actions. The exclusive property in an event definition indicates how an event match is calculated. In case the value of exclusive property is false, then all CloudEvent types in the eventRefs array must be received for a match to occur. Otherwise, the reception of the referenced CloudEvent types is considered a match. The following is an example of event definitions, consisting of two CloudEvent types including noisy and silent: Example event definitions \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"noisyEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"noisy\", \"dataOnly\" : \"false\" }, { \"name\": \"silentEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"silent\" } ] To indicate that an event match occurs when both noisy and silent CloudEvent types are received and to execute different actions for both CloudEvent types, define an event state containing both event definitions in separate onEvent items and set exclusive property to false. Example event state defintion with multiple onEvent items { \"name\": \"waitForEvent\", \"type\": \"event\", \"onEvents\": [ { \"eventRefs\": [ \"noisyEvent\" ], \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"letsGetLoud\" } ] }, { \"eventRefs\": [ \"silentEvent\" ], \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"beQuiet\" } ] } ] , \"exclusive\": false } To execute the same action when both event types are received, use only one onEvent item as shown in the following example: Example event state definition with single onEvent item { \"name\": \"waitForEvent\", \"type\": \"event\", \"onEvents\": [ { \"eventRefs\": [ \"noisyEvent\", \"silentEvent\" ], \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"notCareAboutNoise\" } ] } ] , \"exclusive\": false } If you want the same action to be executed when any of the event types is received, set the exclusive property to true as shown in the following example: Example event state definition executing same action { \"name\": \"waitForEvent\", \"type\": \"event\", \"onEvents\": [ { \"eventRefs\": [ \"noisyEvent\", \"silentEvent\" ], \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"notCareAboutNoise\" } ] } ] ,\"exclusive\": true } You can also remove the exclusive property, as true is the default value. To start a new workflow instance, set the start property to the event state name in the workflow header. The workflow instance starts when there is an event match. Using the previous example of event state definition, add the following code in the workflow header: Start a workflow instance \"start\":\"waitForEvent\" An event state can also be used to pause an existing workflow instance. When the workflow execution reaches an event state, which is not starting, then the execution is paused until there is an event match for that workflow instance. Similar to the callback state in a workflow, the workflow instance to be resumed is identified by kogitoprocrefid CloudEvent attribute or calculated according to the event correlation functionality. While callback state is used for fire&wait scenarios, event state covers wait&fire scenarios. For more information about the callback state, see Callback state in SonataFlow.

For example, you can configure how long a workflow can wait for an event to arrive when it is in a given state, etc. Currently, SonataFlow supports only the workflow execution timeout and event timeouts. Regardless of its application scope (workflow or state), the timeouts must be configured as an amount of time (a duration), which is considered to start when the referred scope becomes active. Timeouts use the ISO 8601 data and time standard to specify a duration of time and follow the format PnDTnHnMn.nS with days considered to be exactly 24 hours. For instance, PT15M configures 15 minutes, and P2DT3H4M defines 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes. Month based timeouts like P2M (period of two months) are not valid since the month duration might vary. In that case you can use PT60D instead. To configure the maximum amount of time a workflow can be running before being canceled, you can use the workflow timeout. This is configured in the header section of the workflow, by using the WorkflowExecTimeout definition. Only the duration property is currently implemented. Once canceled, the workflow is considered to be finished, and will not be accessible through a GET request anymore. So it behaves as if the interrupt was true by default. For example, to cancel the workflow after an hour of execution, you must use the following configuration. Example of workflow timeout { \"id\": \"workflow_timeouts\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"name\": \"Workflow Timeouts\", \"description\": \"Simple workflow to show the workflowExecTimeout working\", \"start\": \"PrintStartMessage\", \"timeouts\": { \"workflowExecTimeout\": \"PT1H\" } ... } When you define a state in a workflow, you can use the timeouts property to configure the maximum time to complete this state. When that time is overdue, the state is considered timed-out, and the engine continues the execution from this state. The execution flow depends on the state type, for instance, a transition to a next state might be executed. All the properties that you can use to configure state timeouts are described in the Serverless Workflow specification. Event-based states can use the sub-property eventTimeout to configure the maximum time to wait for an event to arrive. This is the only property that is supported in current implementation. The Callback state can be used when you need to execute an action, in general to call an external service, and wait for an asynchronous response in form of an event, the callback. Once the response event is consumed, the workflow continues the execution, in general moving to the next state defined in the transition property. See more on Callback state in SonataFlow. Since the Callback state halts the execution until the event is consumed, you can configure an eventTimeout for it, and in case the event does not arrive in the configured time duration, the workflow continues the execution moving to the next state defined in the transition, see the example. Example of Callback state with timeout { \"name\": \"CallbackState\", \"type\": \"callback\", \"action\": { \"name\": \"callbackAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"callbackFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"input\": \"${\\\"callback-state-timeouts: \\\" + $WORKFLOW.instanceId + \\\" has executed the callbackFunction.\\\"}\" } } }, \"eventRef\": \"callbackEvent\", \"transition\": \"CheckEventArrival\", \"onErrors\": [ { \"errorRef\": \"callbackError\", \"transition\": \"FinalizeWithError\" } ], \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT30S\" } } The Switch state can be used when you need to take an action depending on certain conditions, these conditions can be based on the workflow data, dataConditions, or on events, eventConditions. When you use the eventConditions, the workflow execution waits to make a decision until any of the configured events arrives and matches a condition. In this situation, you can configure an event timeout, that controls the maximum time to wait for an event to match the conditions. If this time expires, the workflow moves to the state defined in the defaultCondition property of the Switch state, as you can see in the example. See more details about this state on the Serverless Workflow specification - Switch State. Example of Switch state with timeout { \"name\": \"ChooseOnEvent\", \"type\": \"switch\", \"eventConditions\": [ { \"eventRef\": \"visaApprovedEvent\", \"transition\": \"ApprovedVisa\" }, { \"eventRef\": \"visaDeniedEvent\", \"transition\": \"DeniedVisa\" } ], \"defaultCondition\": { \"transition\": \"HandleNoVisaDecision\" }, \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT5S\" } } The Event state is used to wait for one or more events to be received by the workflow, execute a set of actions, and then continue the execution. If the Event state is a starting state, a new workflow instance is created. The Event state is not supported as a starting state if the exclusive flag is set to false, therefore timeout is not supported in this case. The timeouts property is used for this state to configure the maximum time the workflow should wait for the configured events to arrive. If this time is exceeded and the events are not received, the workflow moves to the state defined in the transition property or ends the workflow instance (in case of an end state), without performing any actions. You can see this in the example. For more information about Event state timeout, see Serverless Workflow specification - Event State. Example of Event state with timeout { \"name\": \"WaitForEvent\", \"type\": \"event\", \"onEvents\": [ { \"eventRefs\": [ \"event1\" ], \"eventDataFilter\": { \"data\": \"${ \\\"The event1 was received.\\\" }\", \"toStateData\": \"${ .exitMessage }\" }, \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAfterEvent1\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"systemOut\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"${\\\"event-state-timeouts: \\\" + $WORKFLOW.instanceId + \\\" executing actions for event1.\\\"}\" } } } ] }, { \"eventRefs\": [ \"event2\" ], \"eventDataFilter\": { \"data\": \"${ \\\"The event2 was received.\\\" }\", \"toStateData\": \"${ .exitMessage }\" }, \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAfterEvent2\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"systemOut\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"${\\\"event-state-timeouts: \\\" + $WORKFLOW.instanceId + \\\" executing actions for event2.\\\"}\" } } } ] } ], \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT30S\" }, \"transition\": \"PrintExitMessage\" } To deploy a workflow that uses timeouts, or any other timer-based action, it is necessary to have a job service running in your environment, which is an independent service responsible to control the workflows timers, see the job service for more information. The provisioning of this service depends on the work mode that you are using. When you work with the SonataFlow Operator Dev Profile, the operator will automatically provide an execution environment that contains an embedded job service instance, as well as an instance of the data index service. And thus, there is no need for additional configurations. In the timeouts showcase you can see the details of how to work with timeouts and the SonataFlow Operator Dev Profile. When you work with a standalone Quarkus Workflow Project, you must: Configure the project to include the required addon for the workflows to connect with that service. Ensure that a jobs service instance is available in your environment. In the job service guide you can see all the available add-ons and configuration alternatives for this case.

The workflow expressions in the Serverless Workflow specification are used to interact with the data model. The supported expression languages include JsonPath and jq. jq expression language is the default language. However, you can change the expression language to JsonPath using the expressionLang property. This document describes the usage of jq expressions in functions, switch state conditions, action function arguments, data filtering, and event publishing. JQ expression might be tricky to master, for non-trivial cases, it is recommended to use helper tools like JQ Play to validate the expression before including it in the workflow file. Expressions can be used in functions of type expression to manipulate the workflow model. As with any other function, the result of the expression evaluation will be merged into the model. For example, in the serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application, a max function adds to the model two properties: max, containing the maximum value of x coordinate in the numbers array (which is a workflow input parameter) and min, containing the minimum value of y coordinate Example conditions in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus { \"name\": \"max\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \"{max: .numbers | max_by(.x), min: .numbers | min_by(.y)}\" } The conditions occurring in a switch state enable the workflow designer to select the path that workflow follows based on the data model content. A condition in a switch state is an expression, which returns a boolean value when evaluated against the data model. If a condition associated with a state transition returns true, then the workflow must follow that transition. For example, in the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application, a message is displayed depending on the selected language, that is English or Spanish. If the value of the language property is English, the constant literal injected on the message property is Hello from, otherwise the constant value injected on the message property is Saludos desde…. The switch state in the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application contains the following conditions, which in turn contains two jq expressions returning a boolean. Example conditions in serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \"dataConditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"${ .language == \\\"English\\\" }\", \"transition\": \"GreetInEnglish\" }, { \"condition\": \"${ .language == \\\"Spanish\\\" }\", \"transition\": \"GreetInSpanish\" } ] The Serverless Workflow specification requires all the expressions to be embedded within ${… }. However, SonataFlow figures out whether or not a string is an expression. Therefore, you can save characters and skip ${ in the beginning and } in the end. In case of portability, you must embed the expressions within ${… }. In the Serverless Workflow specification, you can define workflow functions, which can be invoked several times by the workflow states. Each workflow function call might contain different arguments, which are specified using the function arguments. For example, you can see the temperature conversion function definition in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application. The temperature conversion function performs OpenAPI invocations to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. For more information about OpenAPI, see Orchestrating the OpenAPI services. Following is the subtraction function in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application: Example subtraction function in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"subtraction\", \"operation\": \"specs/subtraction.yaml#doOperation\" }] The arguments in subtraction function are expressed as a JSON object, and the property values of the JSON object are either a string containing an expression or a JSON data type, such as string, number, or boolean. Example arguments in subtraction function \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subtraction\", \"arguments\": { \"leftElement\": \".fahrenheit\", \"rightElement\": \".subtractValue\" } } In the previous example, the left number is equal to the fahrenheit property (an input number that invokes the workflow), and the right number is equal to the subtractValue property (a constant number that is injected to the workflow model by SetConstants state). Once the expression evaluation is resolved for all properties that contain an expression, the resulting object is passed in the OpenAPI request. Based on the OpenAPI definition, the properties in the JSON object are used as body, path, query, or header of the upcoming REST invocation. Following is an example of function arguments defined as string that contains an expression, returning a JSON object: Example function arguments defined as string \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subtraction\", \"arguments\": \"{leftElement: .fahrenheit, rightElement : .subtractValue}\" } In the previous example, the result of the expression evaluation is the same JSON object than in the first case, which is passed as arguments of the OpenAPI request. The Serverless Workflow specification defines the following filtering mechanisms to select which information must be part of the workflow data model: Action data filters: Select the part of the action result that is merged into the data model, which overrides the properties that share the name with the selected action result. Event data filters: Similar to the action data filters, but apply to the events instead of actions. State data filters: Define the workflow model to the JSON object, which is returned by the expression and discards an existing property. State and Action data filter example You can see serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application, in which actions and state data filters are used. Following is an expression function in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application: Example expression function in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"max\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \"{max: .numbers | max_by(.x), min: .numbers | min_by(.y)}\" } ] In the previous example, an array of complex numbers (x is real coordinate and y is imaginary coordinate) is accepted and an expression function is defined to calculate the maximum value of x and minimum value of y for the numbers array. Also, the serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application contains an action data filter defined inside squareState action and a state data filter defined inside finish state. The action data filter selects the maximum value of x to be merged to the workflow model, and the state data filter defines the maximum value as the entire workflow model that is returned as the workflow response. The previous example expression also contains a max function of type expression and an operation property containing a string of jq expression. This jq expression returns a JSON object, in which the max property is the maximum value of the x coordinate and the min property is the minimum value of the y coordinate. Following is an action data filter in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application: Example action data filter in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"maxAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"max\" }, \"actionDataFilter\": { \"results\" : \".max.x\", \"toStateData\" : \".number\" } } ] In case the previous example of action data filter is not added in the serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus, then the entire JSON object returned by the function is merged into the workflow model. The previous action data filter contains the following properties: results, selecting the attribute from the data returned by the action. toStateData, indicating the name of the target property inside the workflow model. If the target property does not exist, then a target property is added. Therefore, after executing the action, the workflow model consists of a number property, containing the maximum value of x and the original numbers array. After that, the workflow transitions to the finish state. Example state data filter in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus \"name\": \"finish\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"stateDataFilter\": { \"input\": \"{result: .number}\" } The original numbers array should not be returned as a result of the workflow execution, therefore the final stage consists of a state data filter defining the content of the output model. The output model should contain a result property and the value of result property should be the maximum number that is stored by the previous state in the number property. In the previous example, the workflow model is changed by the input property of the filter, which means that the output model is updated before the state is executed. As a final result, the output model consists of a result property, containing the maximum value of x. Event data filter example You can find an example of event data filtering in the serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus example application. Example event filter \"eventRef\": \"waitEvent\", \"eventDataFilter\": { \"data\": \".result\", \"toStateData\": \".move\" } The previous example of the event filter copies the content of CloudEvent data result field into the workflow model move field. When publishing a Cloud Event, you can select the data that is being published using a jq expression that generates a JSON object. Note that in yaml double quotes are required to allow using {} characters. Example data expression returning an object transition: nextState: WaitForSaveTransformationCompletionEvent produceEvents: - eventRef: saveTransformationEvent data: \"{gitRepo:.repositoryURL|sub(\\\"http(s)?://\\\";\\\"ssh://\\\"), branch: .targetBranch, token: .token, workspaceId: .workspaceId, projectId: .projectId, transformId: .transformId, workflowCallerId: $WORKFLOW.instanceId}\" In the previous example, a CloudEvent was published when the state transitioned. Its data field looks like Example of generated event data={\"gitRepo\":\"ssh://bitbucket.org/m2k-test\",\"branch\":\"aaaaaaasssss\",\"token\":null,\"workspaceId\":\"b93980cb-3943-4223-9441-8694c098eeb9\",\"projectId\":\"9b305fe3-d441-48ce-b01b-d314e86e14ec\",\"transformId\":\"723dce89-c25c-4c7b-9ef3-842de92e6fe6\",\"workflowCallerId\":\"7ddb5193-bedc-4942-a857-596b31f377ed\"} ForEach iteratiomParam should be accessed as a variable, using a $ prefix, not as a JSON property, since the loop variable is not part of the workflow model the expression is evaluated against. Therefore, instead of accessing it like a JSON property (with a . prefix), the loop variable should be referenced with a $ prefix For instance, this ForEach specification example \"states\": [ { \"name\":\"SendConfirmState\", \"type\":\"foreach\", \"inputCollection\": \"${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }\", \"iterationParam\": \"completedorder\", \"outputCollection\": \"${ .confirmationresults }\", \"actions\":[ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"sendConfirmationFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"orderNumber\": \"${ .completedorder.orderNumber }\", \"email\": \"${ .completedorder.email }\" } } }], \"end\": true }] should be modified to \"states\": [ { \"name\":\"SendConfirmState\", \"type\":\"foreach\", \"inputCollection\": \"${ [.orders[] | select(.completed == true)] }\", \"iterationParam\": \"completedorder\", \"outputCollection\": \"${ .confirmationresults }\", \"actions\":[ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"sendConfirmationFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"orderNumber\": \"${ $completedorder.orderNumber }\", \"email\": \"${ $completedorder.email }\" } } }], \"end\": true }] As per specification, you can use Workflow Constants and Workflow Secrets whenever an expression is accepted. In SonataFlow you can use $SECRET to access any configuration property, not just sensitive ones. So, assuming you have added to your application.properties a line with the myname=john property, the following function will append the string my name is john to the message variable { \"name\": \"secretMessage\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".message |= \\\"my name is \\\"+$SECRET.my_name\" } $SECRET always returns a value of type string. If you want to use it in a comparison with a value that is not a string, you must perform the conversion explicitly. In the next example, the retries property is a number, so we need to convert the property value accordingly by calling the tonumber built-in jq function. { \"condition\": \".retries > ($SECRET._max_retries|tonumber)\" } Besides constants and secrets, you might access contextual information of the running workflow by using the $WORKFLOW reserved word. SonataFlow supports the following contextual keys: id: The id of the running workflow definition name: The name of the running workflow definition instanceId: The id of the running workflow instance headers: Optional map containing the headers, if any, of the invocation that started the running workflow instance prevActionResult: In a foreach state using multiple actions per loop cycle, give access to the result of the previous action. See example identity: Quarkus security identity Therefore, the following function, for a serverless workflow definition whose id is expressionTest, will append the string worklow id is expressionTest to the message variable { \"name\": \"contextMessage\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".message |= \\\"workflow id is \\\"+$WORKFLOW.id\" } In addition to the predefined keys mentioned previously, you can add your own keys to workflow context using Java Service Loader mechanism, by providing an implementation of class KogitoProcessContextResolverExtension This feature was used to add quarkus security identity support, you can check source code as reference here. link:https://jiehong.gitlab.io/jq_offline [JQ Play offline] Configuring the OpenAPI services endpoints If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

The Serverless Workflow specification provides an error handling mechanism, enabling you to handle the errors that might happen during the interactions between the workflow and external systems. When an error occurs, it changes the regular workflow sequence. In such cases, a workflow state transitions to an alternative state that can potentially handle the error, instead of transitioning to the predefined state. Note that error definition for a workflow is optional. If error handling is not defined, then the workflow execution is aborted when an error occurs. As a developer, you can consider the error handling in SonataFlow as a try-catch or a goto construct. An error definition in a workflow is composed of a name and code parameters. The name is a short and natural language description of an error, such as wrong parameter. The code parameter helps the implementation to identify the error. The code parameter is mandatory and the engine uses different strategies to map the provided value to an exception encountered at runtime. The available strategies include fully qualified class name, error message, and status code. Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN) You can define the mapping as the fully qualified Java class name of an exception type. To determine if an exception is handled by an error definition, a workflow first checks whether or not the type of the Java exception is an instance of the exception that is specified in the error definition. Otherwise, the workflow recursively applies the same check to any embedded exception within the original Java one, till the exception chain is exhausted. Table 1. Runtime exception examples: Runtime exception Error code definition java.lang.RuntimeException java.lang.RuntimeException java.lang.IllegalStateException java.lang.RuntimeException Error message You can define the mapping as a partial match of the error message using regex patterns. A workflow verifies whether the message of the Java exception matches the value provided in the error code. The validation is performed using a regex matcher. The validation is successful if a partial match is found. Note that the validation is performed in a case-sensitive manner. If case-insensitive pattern matching is desired, use the embedded flag expression (?i) within the regular expression. Table 2. Error message examples: Error message of runtime exception Error code definition Unknown error, status code 400 Unknown error Unknown error, status code 400 (?i)Error or error Unknown error, status code 400 (.*)status code 4[0-9]{2} or status code 4[0-9]{2} Status code You can define the mapping as a status code returned by the invoked service. The external services return status codes in the event of a failure. For example, HTTP status codes are returned by REST or OpenAPI service invocations. In this case, the workflow verifies the defined error code against the HTTP code from the underlying response object. You can define the error code either as an HTTP code or as a colon-separated string, in which the error definition contains the error code in the last part. Table 3. Status code examples: HTTP status code Error code definition 400 400 400 HTTP:400 The workflow in the serverless-workflow-error-quarkus example application illustrate the usage of the error handling mechanism. Figure 1. Example of error handling The workflow accepts an integer number as the input model. When the workflow starts, it invokes the isEven Java service, which accepts that integer number as a parameter. This service throws an IllegalArgumentException exception if the integer number is odd. This means that if the integer number is even, the workflow transitions to the even state, however, if the integer number is odd, the workflow transitions to the odd state, resulting in a different model output. Example checkEven state { \"name\": \"checkEven\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"checkEvenAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"isEven\", \"arguments\": { \"number\": \"$.number\" } } } ], \"transition\": \"even\", \"onErrors\": [ { \"errorRef\": \"odd number\", \"transition\": \"odd\" } ] } The workflow defines a function that invokes the isEven method of org.kie.kogito.examples.EvenService class. This function uses a custom function type, enabling SonataFlow to invoke Java methods. Example isEven function definition { \"name\": \"isEven\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"service:java:org.kie.kogito.examples.EvenService::isEven\" } To handle the error, the workflow defines an odd number error which handles any runtime exception. As the IllegalArgumentException is a child of RuntimeException, if isEven method throws the exception, it will be handled. Example error definition \"errors\": [ { \"name\": \"odd number\", \"code\": \"java.lang.RuntimeException\" } ] The Inject state is used to populate the model with specific JSON payload. Therefore, the even and odd state defines the message property as even and odd respectively. { \"name\": \"even\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"numberType\": \"even\" }, \"transition\": \"finish\" }, { \"name\": \"odd\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"numberType\": \"odd\" }, \"transition\": \"finish\" } The finish state in the serverless-workflow-error-quarkus example application displays the model content to the console, so you can verify that the expected message has been set. { \"name\": \"finish\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"printMessage\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"$.numberType\" } } } ], \"end\": { \"terminate\": \"true\" } } [getting-started/introduction-sonataflow-development-guide] If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

The Callback state performs an action and waits for an event, to be produced as a result of the action, to resume the workflow. The action peformed by a Callback state is an asynchronous external service invocation. Therefore, the Callback state is suitable to perform fire&wait-for-result operations. From a workflow perspective, asynchronous service indicates that the control is returned to the caller immediately without waiting for the action to be completed. Once the action is completed, a CloudEvent is published to resume the workflow. For the workflow to identify the published CloudEvent it is waiting for, the external service developer includes the workflow instance ID in the CloudEvent header or uses the Event correlation.

The testing procedure described in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-service-calls-quarkus example application in GitHub repository. SonataFlow serializes the execution of parallel tasks. Therefore, the word \"parallel\" does not indicate simultaneous execution, but it means that there is no logical dependency between the execution of branches. An inactive branch can start or resume the execution of a task without waiting for an active branch to be completed, in case the latter suspends the execution (for example, wait for an event reception). The serverless-workflow-service-calls-quarkus example application is a workflow that concatenates three strings and returns a result. The concatenation in the example application is done in parallel, which includes one branch per three strings. You can create a workflow, which performs a series of parallel tasks. Prerequisites A workflow project is created. For more information about creating a workflow project, see Creating your first workflow project. Procedure Create a workflow file named as parallel.sw.json under the src/main/resources/ directory. Add the following content to the parallel.sw.json file: Example content for parallel.sw.json file { \"id\": \"parallel\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"name\": \"Welcome to the Parallel dimension\", \"description\": \"Testing parallelism\", \"start\": \"Parallel\", \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"concatA\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".result|=.+\\\"A\\\"\" (1) }, { \"name\": \"concatB\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".result|=.+\\\"B\\\"\" (2) }, { \"name\": \"concatC\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".result|=.+\\\"C\\\"\" (3) } ], \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"Parallel\", \"type\": \"parallel\", (4) \"branches\": [ (5) { \"name\": \"branchA\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"concatA\" (6) } ] }, { \"name\": \"branchB\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"concatB\" (7) } ] }, { \"name\": \"branchC\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"concatC\" (8) } ] } ], \"completionType\": \"allOf\", (9) \"end\": { \"terminate\": true } } ] } 1 Function that concatenates the string A. 2 Function that concatenates the string B. 3 Function that concatenates the string C. 4 Defines the type of the state as parallel. 5 Defines the branches that run in parallel. 6 Defines the function that runs in branchA. 7 Defines the function that runs in branchB. 8 Defines the function that runs in branchC. 9 Defines the completion type of the parallel state as allOf. This means that the parallel state is completed when all the branches are completed. After you create a workflow that performs a series of parallel tasks, you can run the workflow. Prerequisites A parallel workflow is created. For more information, see Creating a parallel workflow. The workflow application is up and running. You can start the workflow application in development mode by using the following command: mvn quarkus:dev Procedure To run the created parallel workflow, send a request to the /parallel endpoint as shown in the following example request: Example request curl -X 'POST' \\ 'http://localhost:8080/parallel' \\ -H 'accept: */*' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{}' Example response {\"id\":\"358f97ba-f0f9-4f25-86cc-4b35e85c2406\",\"workflowdata\":{\"result\":\"ABC\"}} The \"result\":\"ABC\" in the previous example response might be different in each request since the branches are running in parallel and the execution order of the branches is unpredictable. Note that the parallel workflow data shows the concatenated string as result. You can define the \"completionType\": \"atLeast\" to run only some branches in parallel workflow, instead of defining \"completionType\": \"allOf\". When you define \"completionType\": \"atLeast\", you also need to define the minimum number of branches that you want to run by defining the \"numCompleted\": property. Prerequisites A parallel workflow is created. For more information, see Creating a parallel workflow. Procedure Change the completionType property to \"atLeast\" and add the \"numCompleted\": 2 property to the parallel state. Example parallel workflow { \"id\": \"parallel\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"name\": \"Welcome to the Parallel dimension\", \"description\": \"Testing parallelism\", \"start\": \"Parallel\", \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"concatA\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".result|=.+\\\"A\\\"\" }, { \"name\": \"concatB\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".result|=.+\\\"B\\\"\" }, { \"name\": \"concatC\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \".result|=.+\\\"C\\\"\" } ], \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"Parallel\", \"type\": \"parallel\", \"branches\": [ { \"name\": \"branchA\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"concatA\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"branchB\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"concatB\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"branchC\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": \"concatC\" } ] } ], \"completionType\": \"atLeast\", (1) \"numCompleted\": \"2\", (2) \"end\": { \"terminate\": true } } ] } 1 Defines the completion type of the parallel state as atLeast. 2 Defines the minimum number of branches that you want to run. This means that the parallel state is completed when at least two branches are completed. To run the created parallel workflow, send a request to the /parallel endpoint as shown in the following example: Example request curl -X 'POST' \\ 'http://localhost:8080/parallel' \\ -H 'accept: */*' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{}' Example response {\"id\":\"3da62df1-c4e7-48c9-a3e4-7f63872c92f4\",\"workflowdata\":{\"result\":\"BC\"}} The \"result\":\"BC\" in the response might be different in each request. The parallel workflow data shows the concatenated string as result, but in this case, the workflow concatenates only two letters.

Data Index service is a dedicated supporting service that stores the data related to the workflow instances and their associated jobs. This service provides a GraphQL endpoint allowing users to query and modify that data. The data processed by the Data Index service are received via events. The events that Data Index consumes can be generated by any workflow or the Job service itself. This event communication can be configured in different ways as described in the Data Index communication configuration section. The Data Index service uses Apache Kafka or Knative eventing to consume CloudEvents messages from workflows. The event data is indexed and stored in the database for access via GraphQL. These events contain information about units of work executed for a workflow. The Data Index service is at the core of all SonataFlow search, insight, and management capabilities. The SonataFlow Data Index Service has the following key attributes: Flexible data structure Distributable and cloud-ready format Message-based communication with workflows (Apache Kafka, Knative, CloudEvents) Powerful querying API using GraphQL Management capabilities using the Gateway API, to perform actions using GraphQL syntax on remote runtimes with a single entrypoint The SonataFlow Data Index Service is a Quarkus application, based on Vert.x with Reactive Messaging, that exposes a GraphQL endpoint that client applications use to access indexed data and perform management operations related to running workflow instances. The indexing functionality in the Data Index service is provided by choosing one of the following persistence providers: PostgreSQL The Data Index Service has been designed as an application to store and query the existing workflow data. The data comes within events. The service allows multiple connection options as described in the Data Index service communication configuration section. Data Index is distributed in different ways to allow deployment in different topologies, and depending on how the data is indexed. The following sections describe the different options of Data Index deployments. It can be deployed explicitly referencing the image, starting a separated service inside a container. See Data Index standalone. This type of deployment requires to choose the right image depending on the persistence, specify the database connection properties, and the event consumption configuration. When the Quarkus Dev mode is used in the SonataFlow application, Data Index can be deployed transparently as a Quarkus Development Service. When the SonataFlow Process Quarkus extension is utilized, a temporary Data Index Service is automatically provisioned while the Quarkus application runs in development mode making the Quarkus Dev Service available for use. More details are provided in the Data Index as a Quarkus Development service section. The SonataFlow Process Quarkus extension sets up your Quarkus application to automatically replicate any SonataFlow messaging events related to workflow instances or jobs into the provisioned Data Index instance. For more information about Quarkus Dev Services, see Dev Services guide. Data Index can be included as part of the same SonataFlow application using the Data Index extension, through the provided addons. This scenario is specific to add the Data Index data indexing features and the GraphQL endpoint exposure inside a workflow application. The communication with the workflow where the extension is added, is something internal to the application, allowing to simplify the communication between services and avoiding extra configuration for that purpose. In this case, the indexation has some limitations: it is only able to index data from the workflows deployed in the same application. More details are available in the Data Index Quarkus Extension section. In order to store the indexed data, Data Index needs some specific tables to be created. Data Index is ready to use Quarkus flyway for that purpose. Activating the 'migrate-at-start' option enables automatic migration of the Data Index schema. For more details about Flyway migrations, see PostgreSQL Database Migration section. Data Index provides GraphQL endpoint that allows users to interact with the stored data. For more information about GraphQL see GraphQL documentation This guide provides as examples, some GraphQL queries that allow to retrieve data about workflow instances and jobs. Retrieve data from workflow instances You can retrieve data about a specified instance from your workflow definition. Example query { ProcessInstances { id processId state parentProcessInstanceId rootProcessId rootProcessInstanceId variables nodes { id name type } } } Retrieve data from jobs You can retrieve data from a specified job instance. Example query { Jobs { id status priority processId processInstanceId executionCounter } } Filter query results using the where parameter You can use the where parameter with multiple combinations to filter query results based on workflow attributes. Example query { ProcessInstances(where: {state: {equal: ACTIVE}}) { id processId processName start state variables } } Example query { ProcessInstances(where: {id: {equal: \"d43a56b6-fb11-4066-b689-d70386b9a375\"}}) { id processId processName start state variables } } By default, all filtered attributes are executed as AND operations in queries. You can modify this behavior by combining filters with an AND or OR operator. Example query { ProcessInstances(where: {or: {state: {equal: ACTIVE}, rootProcessId: {isNull: false}}}) { id processId processName start end state } } Example query { ProcessInstances(where: {and: {processId: {equal: \"travels\"}, or: {state: {equal: ACTIVE}, rootProcessId: {isNull: false}}}}) { id processId processName start end state } } Depending on the attribute type, the following operators are also available: String array argument: contains : String containsAll: Array of strings containsAny: Array of strings isNull: Boolean (true or false) String argument: in: Array of strings like: String isNull: Boolean (true or false) equal: String ID argument: in: Array of strings equal: String isNull: Boolean (true or false) Boolean argument: isNull: Boolean (true or false) equal: Boolean (true or false) Numeric argument: in: Array of integers isNull: Boolean equal: Integer greaterThan: Integer greaterThanEqual: Integer lessThan: Integer lessThanEqual: Integer between: Numeric range (with from and to Integer values required) Date argument: isNull: Boolean (true or false) equal: Date time greaterThan: Date time greaterThanEqual: Date time lessThan: Date time lessThanEqual: Date time between: Date range (with from and to Date time values required) Enum argument: equal: Enum value in: Array of enum values Sort query results using the orderBy parameter You can use the orderBy parameter to sort query results based on workflow attributes. You can also specify the direction of sorting in ascending ASC order or descending DESC order. Multiple attributes are applied to the database query in the order they are specified in the query filter. Example query { ProcessInstances(where: {state: {equal: ACTIVE}}, orderBy: {start: ASC}) { id processId processName start end state } } Limit and offset query results using the pagination parameter You can use the pagination parameter to specify a limit and offset for query results. Example query { ProcessInstances(where: {state: {equal: ACTIVE}}, orderBy: {start: ASC}, pagination: {limit: 10, offset: 0}) { id processId processName start end state } } Data Index incorporates a set of queries or mutations that allow firing operations on workflow endpoints using GraphQL notation. The Data Index Gateway API enables you to perform the following operations: Abort a workflow instance Retrieves a workflow instance with the ID passed as a parameter and launches the abort operation on related SonataFlow service. Example mutation for abort operation mutation { ProcessInstanceAbort (id:\"66e05e9c-eaab-47af-a83e-156498b7096d\") } Retry a workflow instance Retrieves a workflow instance with the id passed as a parameter and launches the retry operation on related SonataFlow service. Example mutation for retry operation mutation { ProcessInstanceRetry (id:\"66e05e9c-eaab-47af-a83e-156498b7096d\") } Skip a workflow instance Retrieves a workflow instance with the ID passed as a parameter and launches the skip operation on related SonataFlow service. Example mutation for skip operation mutation { ProcessInstanceSkip (id:\"66e05e9c-eaab-47af-a83e-156498b7096d\") } Retrieve workflow instance nodes Retrieves the nodes of a workflow instance that are coming from the process definition. When the nodeDefinitions field of a workflow instance is queried, a call to a specific SonataFlow service is generated to retrieve the requested list of available nodes. Example query to retrieve workflow instance nodes {ProcessInstances(where: { id: {equal: \"1017afb1-5749-440e-8b9b-6b876bb5894d\"}}){ diagram }} Update workflow instance variables Updates the variables of a workflow instance using the id passed as a parameter. Retrieves a workflow instance using the id passed as a parameter and launches the update operation on related SonataFlow service with the new values passed in variables parameter. Example mutation to update workflow instance variables mutation { ProcessInstanceUpdateVariables (id:\"23147fcc-da82-43a2-a577-7a36b26094bd\", variables:\"{\\\"it_approval\\\":true,\\\"candidate\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Joe\\\",\\\"email\\\":\\\"jdoe@ts.com\\\",\\\"salary\\\":30000,\\\"skills\\\":\\\"java\\\"},\\\"hr_approval\\\":true}\") } Trigger a node instance Triggers a node instance using the node definition nodeId. The nodeId is included in the nodeInstances of a workflow instance using the id passed as parameter. Example mutation to trigger a node instance mutation{ NodeInstanceTrigger( id: \"9674e3ed-8c13-4c3f-870e-7465d9ca7ca7\", nodeId:\"_B8C4F63C-81AD-4291-9C1B-84967277EEF6\") } Retrigger a node instance Retriggers a node instance using the id, which is similar to nodeInstanceId related to a workflow instance. The id of the workflow instance is passed as a parameter. Example mutation to retrigger a node instance mutation{ NodeInstanceRetrigger( id: \"9674e3ed-8c13-4c3f-870e-7465d9ca7ca7\", nodeInstanceId:\"01756ba2-ac16-4cf1-9d74-154ae8f2df21\") } Cancel a node instance Cancels a node instance with the id, which is similar to nodeInstanceId related to a workflow instance. The id of the workflow instance is passed as a parameter. Example mutation to cancel a node instance mutation{ NodeInstanceCancel( id: \"9674e3ed-8c13-4c3f-870e-7465d9ca7ca7\", nodeInstanceId:\"01756ba2-ac16-4cf1-9d74-154ae8f2df21\") } To enable described management operations on workflow instances, make sure your project is configured to have the kie-addons-quarkus-process-management dependency on its pom.xml file to have this management operations enabled, like: org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-process-management Retrieve the workflow instance source file content Retrieves the workflow instance source file. When the source field of a workflow instance is queried, a call to a specific SonataFlow service is generated to retrieve the requested workflow instance source file content. Example query to retrieve a workflow instance source file content {ProcessInstances(where: { id: {equal: \"1017afb1-5749-440e-8b9b-6b876bb5894d\"}}){ source }} The workflow instance source field only will be available when kie-addons-quarkus-source-files dependency is added on SonataFlow runtime service pom.xml file. org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-source-files Reschedule a job Reschedules a job using the id. The job id and other information are passed in the data parameter. Example mutation to reschedule a job mutation{ JobReschedule( id: \"9674e3ed-8c13-4c3f-870e-7465d9ca7ca7\", data:\"{\\\"expirationTime\\\": \\\"2033-06-27T04:35:54.631Z\\\",\\\"retries\\\": 2}\") } Cancel a job Cancels a job using the id passed as a parameter. Example mutation to cancel a job mutation{ JobCancel( id: \"9674e3ed-8c13-4c3f-870e-7465d9ca7ca7\") } Data Index GraphQL UI is provided to interact with GraphQL endpoint. When the Data Index is deployed as a standalone service, this UI will be available at /graphiql/ endpoint (i.e: at http://localhost:8180/graphiql/) To enable the GraphQL UI when deploying the Data Index extension, the property quarkus.kogito.data-index.graphql.ui.always-include must be enabled. It will be accessible at: /graphql-ui/ (i.e: http://localhost:8080/q/graphql-ui/) The quarkus.http.root-path' and `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path belong to the workflow application where the Data Index extension has been added. Here there are more details about those properties and their default values. In order to index the data, Data Index allows multiple connection options to be able to consume the information provided by the different workflows. The final goal is to receive the application-generated data related to the workflow instances and jobs. The information that comes inside events, is indexed and stored in the database allowing it to be consumed through the provided GraphQL endpoint. In order to interact with the Data Index separated service, use the Knative eventing system eventing: Add the Data Index service and deployment, defining the Database connection properties and setting the KOGITO_DATA_INDEX_QUARKUS_PROFILE to http-events-support. Specify the Knative Triggers to filter the Data Index events. Example DataIndex resource with triggers definition (requires Knative): apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Trigger metadata: name: data-index-service-postgresql-processes-trigger spec: broker: default filter: attributes: type: ProcessInstanceEvent subscriber: ref: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service name: data-index-service-postgresql uri: /processes --- apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Trigger metadata: name: data-index-service-postgresql-jobs-trigger spec: broker: default filter: attributes: type: JobEvent subscriber: ref: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service name: data-index-service-postgresql uri: /jobs Configure the workflow to use the K_SINK as outgoing connection url Example of configuration in SonataFlow application application.properties file to communicate with Knative mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.connector=quarkus-http mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.url=${K_SINK} mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.method=POST Job service needs to be configured to send the events to the Knative K_SINK to have them available for Data Index related triggers. To configure the communication between the Data Index Service and the workflow through Kafka, you must provide a set of configurations. Add the Data Index service and deployment, defining the Database connection properties and setting the KOGITO_DATA_INDEX_QUARKUS_PROFILE to kafka-events-support (this value is set by default). Configure the SonataFlow application to use the smallrye-kafka connector and the expected topic. Example of configuration in SonataFlow application application.properties file to communicate with Kafka mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.connector=smallrye-kafka mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.topic=kogito-processinstances-events mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer Job service is configured to send the JobEvents to the kafka topic kogito-jobs-events to have them available for Data Index consumption. When Data Index functionality is added as a Quarkus extension to the workflow, there is no event configuration. In this case, the data indexation is done internally, and all interactions are through the Data Index Gateway API.

There are different images provided that take into account what persistence layer is required in each case. In each distribution, there are some properties to configure things like the connection with the database or the communication with other services. The goal is to configure the container to allow to process ProcessInstances and Jobs events that incorporate their related data, to index and store that in the database and finally, to provide the Data Index GraphQL endpoint to consume it. Data Index service can be deployed referencing directly a distributed Data Index image. There are the different Data Index image distributions that can be found in here. There are several ways to deploy the Data Index service. But there are some common points in all the deployments: Reference the right Data Index image to match with the type of Database that will store the indexed data. Provide the database connection properties, to allow data index store the indexed data. Data Index service does not initialize its database schema automatically. To initialize the database schema, you need to enable Flyway migration by setting QUARKUS_FLYWAY_MIGRATE_AT_START=true. Define the KOGITO_DATA_INDEX_QUARKUS_PROFILE to set the way that the events will be connected (by default: kafka-events-support but could be also http-events-support). You must prepare the SonataFlow workflow to support the full communication with an external Data Index service. For this purpose, it is important to make sure the following addons are included: SonataFlow workflow addon dependencies to support the connection with external Data Index org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-events-process (1) org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-process-management (2) 1 Allows the workflow to send the events that can be consumed by the Data Index service. 2 Creates the endpoints that allow management operations on workflow instances. Here you can see in example, how the Data Index resource definition can be deployed as part of a docker-compose definition Example of DataIndex resource in a docker-compose deployment using Kafka eventing: data-index: container_name: data-index image: quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-data-index-postgresql:latest (1) ports: - \"8180:8080\" depends_on: postgres: condition: service_healthy volumes: - ./../target/classes/META-INF/resources/persistence/protobuf:/home/kogito/data/protobufs/ environment: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL: \"jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/kogito\" (2) QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: kogito-user QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: kogito-pass QUARKUS_HTTP_CORS_ORIGINS: \"/.*/\" KOGITO_DATA_INDEX_QUARKUS_PROFILE: kafka-events-support (3) QUARKUS_FLYWAY_MIGRATE_AT_START: \"true\" (4) QUARKUS_HIBERNATE_ORM_DATABASE_GENERATION: update 1 Reference the right Data Index image to match with the type of Database, in this case docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-data-index-postgresql:10.0.x 2 Provide the database connection properties. 3 When KOGITO_DATA_INDEX_QUARKUS_PROFILE is not present, the Data Index is configured to use Kafka eventing. 4 To initialize the database schema at start using flyway. When Kafka eventing is used, workflow applications need to be configured to send the events to the Kafka topic kogito-processinstances-events allowing Data Index service to consume the generated events. In this case Data Index is ready to consume the events sent to the topics: kogito-processinstances-events and kogito-jobs-events. It is important to configure the workflows application to send the events to the topic kogito-processinstances-events using the connector smallrye-kafka. More information about how to configure workflows Kafka eventing is available in Consuming and producing events using Apache Kafka in Quarkus guide. To explore the specific configuration to add to the workflow to connect with Data Index using Kafka eventing see Data Index Kafka eventing Example of configuration in SonataFlow application passed in application.properties to configure connection with Data Index using Kafka connector: mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.connector=smallrye-kafka mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.topic=kogito-processinstances-events mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-processinstances-events.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer Usually, when using docker-compose the workflow application generates the container image that is added to docker-compose. If the Kafka eventing configuration values weren’t there before the container image creation, they need to be passed as environment variables. More details about customizing Quarkus generated images can be found in Quarkus Container Images Customizing guide.

It allows matching one or more events with a particular workflow instance. Correlation rules with domain information can be used when defining consumed events to match a workflow instance. Also, event correlation is a practical alternative to the internal identifier processInstanceId since you can use any external domain identifier as a correlation. A correlation definition consists of one or more attributes associated with an event and the respective workflow to which the event belongs. In Serverless Workflow specification, the correlation property defines the possible correlations for a given event. Each element must contain a contextAttributeName property, which is set for the value that matches an attribute from an event. You can optionally set the contextAttributeValue property, which matches the value for the respective attribute defined in contextAttributeName property for the consumed events in a workflow. The incoming events consumed by the engine must contain the correlation attributes, set in the definition as extension context attributes. The correlation attributes are compliant with the CloudEvent format, therefore, the attributes are not part of the event payload. A new workflow instance must be created using an event, which must be declared in the workflow definition file, containing correlation attributes in the event definition section. For more information about events, see Event state in SonataFlow. Once the event is consumed, the engine extracts the correlation attributes and associates the attributes with the created workflow instance. A start event does not trigger a correlation evaluation, but acts as a moment in which correlation attributes and values are set. The correlation attributes and values are evaluated against other incoming events that might trigger the given instance. Therefore, when a non-start event is consumed and correlation attributes are evaluated, then the engine continues the execution of the matched instances (if any). The following figure shows how engine processes the correlation: Figure 1. Event correlation evaluation process You can see the correlation configuration in the serverless-workflow-correlation-quarkus example application, describing the setup and usage of event correlation in a workflow. Figure 2. Event correlation evaluation process The workflow definition file contains the correlation information, in which the events section is defined as follows: Example event correlation in a workflow \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"newAccountEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"newAccountEventType\", \"correlation\": [ { \"contextAttributeName\": \"userid\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"validateAccountEmailEvent\", \"source\": \"workflow\", \"type\": \"validateAccountEmail\" }, { \"name\": \"validatedAccountEmailEvent\", \"source\": \"workflow\", \"type\": \"validatedAccountEmail\", \"correlation\": [ { \"contextAttributeName\": \"userid\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"activateAccountEvent\", \"source\": \"workflow\", \"type\": \"activateAccount\" }, { \"name\": \"activatedAccountEvent\", \"source\": \"workflow\", \"type\": \"activatedAccount\", \"correlation\": [ { \"contextAttributeName\": \"userid\" } ] } ] You can create a workflow by consuming events as defined in the New User Account Request event state. The New User Account Request event state contains a reference of the newAccountEvent event, containing a correlation definition for userid attribute. Example New User Account Request event state definition { \"name\": \"New User Account Request\", \"type\": \"event\", \"onEvents\": [ { \"eventRefs\": [ \"newAccountEvent\" ] } ], \"transition\": \"Validate User Email\" } When the workflow consumes a new event of newAccountEventType type, a workflow instance is created. After that, the events consumed by the same workflow must contain the same correlation attribute and value, such as userid attribute and 12345 value. This correlation attribute and value is used to evaluate and match the workflow instance to continue the workflow execution. Example incoming start event newAccountEvent { \"specversion\": \"0.3\", \"id\": \"1d174d25-46ac-4785-bc76-457c2d37d2fe\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"newAccountEventType\", \"time\": \"2022-07-25T16:30:35.461988261-03:00\", \"userid\": \"12345\", \"data\": { \"email\": \"test@test.com\", \"userId\": \"12345\" } } In SonataFlow, correlating multiple events together is not supported, therefore, the events are evaluated with correlations independently. Using the workflow definition in serverless-workflow-correlation-quarkus example application, you can define other events that are published and consumed by the workflow. The serverless-workflow-correlation-quarkus example application uses callback states, such as Validate User Email. This means that once the workflow execution reaches the callback state, the workflow publishes an event of validateAccountEmailEvent type and waits to receive an event of validatedAccountEmailEvent type. For more information about the callback state, see Callback state in SonataFlow. Example Callback state definition { \"name\": \"Validate User Email\", \"type\": \"callback\", \"action\": { \"name\": \"publish validate event\", \"eventRef\": { \"triggerEventRef\": \"validateAccountEmailEvent\" } }, \"eventRef\": \"validatedAccountEmailEvent\", \"transition\": \"Activate User Account\" } The produced events contain the same correlation attributes when the workflow is created. Example produced Callback state event validateAccountEmailEvent { \"id\": \"7640a0af-b7fb-4d94-9d9d-3aa1ace60e79\", \"source\": \"/process/correlation\", \"type\": \"validateAccountEmail\", \"time\": \"2022-07-25T16:22:53.735128049-03:00\", \"data\": { \"email\": \"test@test.com\", \"userId\": \"12345\" }, \"specversion\": \"1.0\", \"kogitoprocinstanceid\": \"69019826-daef-4fb4-880b-c1658c4e49bc\", \"kogitoprocid\": \"correlation\", \"kogitoprocversion\": \"1.0\", \"kogitousertaskist\": \"1\", \"kogitoproctype\": \"SW\", \"userid\": \"12345\" } All consumed events must contain the same correlation attributes since the consumed events are used to identify the workflow instance. The following example shows the consumed events containing same correlation attributes and values, such as userid and 12345: Consumed Callback state event validatedAccountEmailEvent { \"specversion\": \"1.0\", \"id\": \"953f07a7-aea8-4956-8775-85ab59366fe6\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"validatedAccountEmail\", \"time\": \"2022-07-25T16:29:27.320408379-03:00\", \"userid\": \"12345\", \"data\": null } The engine stores the correlation information in the same persistence mechanism that is configured in the workflow application. If a persistence add-on is not configured, then the correlation information is stored in memory. This means that entire correlation information is lost when the workflow application restarts, therefore this process must be used for testing purposes. For more information about the persistence configuration, see Running a workflow service using PostgreSQL. Currently, only kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc persistence add-on supports correlation. The kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc add-on is configured for PostgreSQL. Other persistence add-ons will be supported in a future release.

Underneath, SonataFlow uses the AsyncAPI Quarkiverse extension. This extension automatically generates all the required Smallrye properties to make SonataFlow work with the servers declared in the AsyncAPI file. Therefore, you do not need to add any property specific to your event broker to make AsyncAPI work. This is a huge advantage over regular event states, where whether using Kafka or Knative, you have to provide additional configuration AsyncAPI Quarkiverse extension only supports kafka and http protocols at the moment. Let’s assume there is an AsyncAPI specification file called asyncAPI.yaml, located in the classpath of your project.

Prerequisites You have set up your environment according to the minimal environment setup guide. Use the create command with kn workflow to scaffold a new SonataFlow project. Procedure Navigate to your development directory and create your project. kn workflow create -n my-sonataflow-project This will create a folder with name my-sonataflow-project and a sample workflow workflow.sw.json cd ./my-sonataflow-project Open the folder in Visual Studio Code and examine or the created workflow.sw.json using the editor provided by the extension. code workflow.sw.json Now you can run the project and execute the workflow. Use the run command with kn workflow to build and run the SonataFlow project locally in development mode. Procedure Run the project. kn workflow run The Development UI will be accessible at localhost:8080/q/dev You can now work on your project. Any changes will be picked up by the hot reload feature. See Workflow instances guide on how to run workflows via Development UI. Once you are done developing your project navigate to the terminal that is running the kn workflow run command and hit Ctrl+C to stop the development environment. You can use any editor to develop your workflow to suit your use case. We recommend getting familiar with Serverless Workflow Specification and guides in Core chapter first. Executing a workflow To test your running workflow project, access the Swagger UI on localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui to examine available endpoints. In order to execute the workflow once, run: curl -X 'POST' \\ 'localhost:8080/hello' \\ -H 'accept: */*' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"workflowdata\": {} }' You should see a similar response: {\"id\": \"\", \"workflowdata\" : {\"message\":\"Hello World\"}} To deploy the finished project to kubernetes cluster, proceed to the next section. Prerequisites You are logged into your kubernetes cluster or started one locally according to the starting cluster for local development guide. You have installed SonataFlow Operator in your kubernetes cluster according to operator installation guide. Use the deploy command with kn workflow to deploy the SonataFlow project into your local cluster. Procedure Create a namespace for your application kubectl create namespace my-sf-application Deploy the workflow to the cluster in the default dev mode. The plugin uses settings located in .//.kube/config to access the cluster. kn workflow deploy --namespace my-sf-application In a separate bash instance create a port mapping: Openshift Minikube Kind oc get route svc/hello --namespace my-sf-application On openshift the route is generated for you in dev mode deployments. Use the URL of the generated route to access your workflow instances using the Developement interface. /q/dev-ui/org.apache.kie.sonataflow.sonataflow-quarkus-devui/workflows minikube service hello --namespace my-sf-application --url Use this URL to access your workflow instances using the Developer UI /q/dev-ui/org.apache.kie.sonataflow.sonataflow-quarkus-devui/workflows # Execute kubectl get services -n my-sf-application # You should see output like this, note the ports NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE hello ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 /80 39s # Execute kubectl port-forward service/hello :80 -n my-sf-application To update the image, run the deploy again, note that this may take some time. You can also direcly edit the Sonataflow resource in the cluster. In dev mode, the operator will update the deployment with the changes. To stop the deployment, use the undeploy command: kn workflow undeploy --namespace my-sf-application To test your workflow application you can use any capable REST client out there. All that is needed is the URL of your deployed workflow project, which is showcase in section above, You can also use the management console provided as part of the development interface.

Therefore, it is assumed you are fluent both in Java and Maven. The workflow definition to be executed can be read from a .json or .yaml file or programmatically defined using the SonataFlow fluent API. Prerequisites Install OpenJDK 17+ Install Apache Maven 3.9.3. The first step is to set up an empty Maven project that includes Workflow executor core dependency. This guide also uses slf4j dependency to avoid using System.out.println Let’s assume you already have a workflow definition written in a JSON file in your project root directory. For example, Hello World definition. To execute it, you must write the following main Java class (standard Java imports and package declaration are intentionally skipped for briefness) import org.kie.kogito.serverless.workflow.executor.StaticWorkflowApplication; import org.kie.kogito.serverless.workflow.models.JsonNodeModel; import org.kie.kogito.serverless.workflow.utils.ServerlessWorkflowUtils; import org.kie.kogito.serverless.workflow.utils.WorkflowFormat; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import io.serverlessworkflow.api.Workflow; public class DefinitionFileExecutor { private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DefinitionFileExecutor.class); public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { try (Reader reader = new FileReader(\"hello.sw.json\"); (1) StaticWorkflowApplication application = StaticWorkflowApplication.create()) { (2) Workflow workflow = ServerlessWorkflowUtils.getWorkflow(reader, WorkflowFormat.JSON); (3) JsonNodeModel result = application.execute(workflow, Collections.emptyMap()); (4) logger.info(\"Workflow execution result is {}\", result.getWorkflowdata()); (5) } } } 1 Reads the workflow file definition from the project root directory 2 Creates a static workflow application object. It is done within the try block since the instance is Closeable. This is the reference that allow you to execute workflow definitions. 3 Reads the Serverless Workflow Java SDK Workflow object from the file. 4 Execute the workflow, passing Workflow reference and no parameters (an empty Map). The result of the workflow execution: process instance id and workflow output model, can be accessed using result variable. 5 Prints the workflow model in the configured standard output. If you compile and execute this Java class, you will see the following log in your configured standard output: Workflow execution result is {\"greeting\":\"Hello World\",\"mantra\":\"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\"} Adding kogito-serverless-workflow-fluent dependency to the Maven setup in the previous section, you can programmatically generate that workflow definition rather than loading it from a file definition by using the fluent API Therefore, you can modify the previous example to generate the same output when it is executed, but rather than creating a FileReader that reads the Workflow object, we create the Workflow object using Java statements. The resulting modified main method is the following try (StaticWorkflowApplication application = StaticWorkflowApplication.create()) { Workflow workflow = workflow(\"HelloWorld\"). (1) start( (2) inject( (3) jsonObject().put(\"greeting\", \"Hello World\").put(\"mantra\",\"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\"))) (4) .end() (5) .build(); (6) logger.info(\"Workflow execution result is {}\",application.execute(workflow, Collections.emptyMap()).getWorkflowdata()); (7) } 1 Creates a workflow which name is HelloWorld 2 Indicate that you are going to specify the start state 3 A Inject state is the start state 4 Inject state accepts static json, therefore this line creates the JSON data 5 End the workflow definition 6 Build the workflow definition 7 Execute and print as in previous example You can find additional and commented examples of fluent API usage (including jq expression evaluation and orchestration of rest services) here Embedded workflow uses a modular approach to keep the number of required dependencies as small as possible. The rationale is to avoid adding something that you will not use to the dependency set. For example, the OpenAPI module is based on a Swagger parser, if you are not going to call any OpenAPI service, it is better to avoid adding Swagger to the dependency set. This means the Core dependency does not include the stuff to use gRPC, OpenAPI, or most custom function types. This is the list of additional dependencies you might need to add depending on the functionality you are using: REST: Add if you use custom Rest function type. Service: Add if your use custom Service function type. OpenAPI: Add if you use OpenAPI function type. See example. gRPC: Add if you use gRPC function type. See example. Python: Add if you use custom Python function type. See example. Events: Add if you use Event or Callback state in your workflow. Only Kafka events are supported right now. See Publisher and Subscriber examples. To enable persistence, you must include the desired SonataFlow persistence add-on as a dependency and set up StaticWorkflowApplication to use the ProcessInstances implementation provided by the add-on. Since, within an embedded environment, you usually do not want to contact an external database, the recommendation is to use the rocksdb embedded database. You do that by adding the rocksdb add-on dependency and adding the following code snippet when you create your StaticWorkflowApplication object. StaticWorkflowApplication.create().processInstancesFactory(new RocksDBProcessInstancesFactory(new Options().setCreateIfMissing(true), tempDir.toString())) See the persistence example.

These tasks are implemented by independent services, and can be started by using any of the Job Service supported interaction modes, based on Http calls or Knative Events delivery. To schedule task execution, you must create a Job configured with the following information: Schedule: the job triggering periodicity. Recipient: the entity that is called on the job execution for the given interaction mode, and receives the execution parameters. In the context of the SonataFlow, the Job Service is responsible for controlling the execution of the time-triggered actions. And thus, all the time-based states that you can use in a workflow, are handled by the interaction between the workflow and the Job Service. For example, every time the workflow execution reaches a state with a configured timeout, a corresponding job is created in the Job Service, and when the timeout is met, a http callback is executed to notify the workflow. To set up this integration you can use different communication alternatives, that must be configured by combining the Job Service and the Quarkus Workflow Project configurations. Alternatively, when you work with SonataFlow Operator workflow deployments, the operator can manage all these configurations. If the project is not configured to use the Job Service, all time-based actions will use an in-memory implementation of that service. However, this setup must not be used in production, since every time the application is restarted, all the timers are lost, making it unsuitable for serverless architectures where applications might scale to zero at any time, etc. If you are working with the SonataFlow Operator be sure that you read this section SonataFlow Operator managed deployments. Since the main goal of the Job Service is to work with the active jobs, such as the scheduled jobs that needs to be executed, when a job reaches a final state, it is removed from the Job Service. However, in some cases where you want to keep the information about the jobs in a permanent repository, you can configure the Job Service to produce status change events, that can be collected by the Data Index Service, where they can be indexed and made available by GraphQL queries. When you work with the SonataFlow Operator to deploy your workflows, there’s no need to do any manual Job Service installation or configuration, the operator already has the ability to do that. Additionally, it can manage all the required configurations for every workflow to connect with it. To learn how to install and configure the Job Service in this case, you must read the Operator Supporting Services section. To execute the Job Service in your docker or Kubernetes environment, you must use any of the following images, depending on the persistence mechanism to use PostgreSQL or Ephemeral. docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-jobs-service-postgresql docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-jobs-ephemeral In the next topics you can see how to configure them. The common configurations and the eventing API configurations are the same for both images. We recommend that you follow this procedure: Identify the image to use depending on the persistence mechanism, and see the required configuration parameters specific for that image. Identify if the Eventing API is required for your needs and see the required configuration parameters. Identify if the project containing your workflows is configured with the appropriate Job Service Quarkus Extension. Finally, when you run the image, you must pass these configurations using environment variables or using system properties with java like names. To configure the image by using environment variables you must pass one environment variable per each parameter. Job Service image configuration for docker execution example docker run -it -e QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=postgres -e VARIABLE_NAME=value docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-jobs-service-postgresql:latest Job Service image configuration for Kubernetes execution example spec: containers: - name: jobs-service-postgresql image: docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-jobs-service-postgresql:latest imagePullPolicy: Always ports: - containerPort: 8080 name: http protocol: TCP env: # Set the image parameters as environment variables in the container definition. - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE valueFrom: fieldRef: fieldPath: metadata.namespace - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME value: postgres - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD value: pass - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL value: jdbc:postgresql://timeouts-showcase-database:5432/postgres?currentSchema=jobs-service - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_REACTIVE_URL value: postgresql://timeouts-showcase-database:5432/postgres?search_path=jobs-service This is the recommended approach when you execute the Job Service in Kubernetes. The timeouts showcase example Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services contains an example of this configuration, see. On the other hand, when you work with the SonataFlow Operator, it can automatically manage all these configurations, see. To configure the image by using system properties you must pass one property per parameter, however, in this case, all these properties are passed as part of a single environment with the name JAVA_OPTIONS. Job Service image configuration for docker execution example docker run -it -e JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dquarkus.datasource.username=postgres -Dmy.sys.prop1=value1 -Dmy.sys.prop2=value2' \\ docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-jobs-service-postgresql:latest I case that you need to convert a java like property name, to the corresponding environment variable name, to use the environment variables configuration alternative, you must apply the naming convention defined in the Quarkus Configuration Reference. For example, the name quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url must be converted to QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL. Common configurations that affect the job execution retries, startup procedure, etc. Using environment variables Using system properties with java like names Name Description Default KOGITO_JOBS_SERVICE_BACKOFFRETRYMILLIS A long value that defines the retry back-off time in milliseconds between job execution attempts, in case the execution fails. 1000 KOGITO_JOBS_SERVICE_MAXINTERVALLIMITTORETRYMILLIS A long value that defines the maximum interval in milliseconds when retrying to execute jobs, in case the execution fails. 60000 Name Description Default kogito.jobs-service.backoffRetryMillis A long value that defines the retry back-off time in milliseconds between job execution attempts, in case the execution fails. 1000 kogito.jobs-service.maxIntervalLimitToRetryMillis A long value that defines the maximum interval in milliseconds when retrying to execute jobs, in case the execution fails. 60000 PostgreSQL is the recommended database to use with the Job Service. Additionally, it provides an initialization procedure that integrates Flyway for the database initialization. Which automatically controls the database schema, in this way, the tables are created or updated by the service when required. In case you need to externally control the database schema, you can check and apply the DDL scripts for the Job Service in the same way as described in Manually executing scripts guide. To configure the Job Service PostgreSQL you must provide these configurations: Using environment variables Using system properties with java like names Variable Description Example value QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME Username to connect to the database. postgres QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD Password to connect to the database pass QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL JDBC datasource url used by Flyway to connect to the database. jdbc:postgresql://timeouts-showcase-database:5432/postgres?currentSchema=jobs-service QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_REACTIVE_URL Reactive datasource url used by the Job Service to connect to the database. postgresql://timeouts-showcase-database:5432/postgres?search_path=jobs-service Variable Description Example value quarkus.datasource.username Username to connect to the database. postgres quarkus.datasource.password Password to connect to the database pass quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url JDBC datasource url used by Flyway to connect to the database. jdbc:postgresql://timeouts-showcase-database:5432/postgres?currentSchema=jobs-service quarkus.datasource.reactive.url Reactive datasource url used by the Job Service to connect to the database. postgresql://timeouts-showcase-database:5432/postgres?search_path=jobs-service The timeouts showcase example Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services, shows how to run a PostgreSQL based Job Service as a Kubernetes deployment. In your local environment you might have to change some of these values to point to your own PostgreSQL database. The Ephemeral persistence mechanism is based on an embedded PostgreSQL database and does not require any specific configuration other thant the common configurations and the Eventing API. The database is recreated on each service restart, and thus, it must be used only for testing purposes. The Job Service provides a Cloud Event based API that can be used to create and delete jobs. This API is useful in deployment scenarios where you want to use an event based communication from the workflow runtime to the Job Service. For the transport of these events you can use the Knative eventing system or the kafka messaging system. By default, the Job Service Eventing API is prepared to work in a Knative eventing system. This means that by adding no additional configurations parameters, it’ll be able to receive cloud events via the Knative eventing system to manage the jobs. However, you must still prepare your Knative eventing environment to ensure these events are properly delivered to the Job Service, see Knative eventing supporting resources. Finally, the only configuration parameter that you must set, when needed, is to enable the propagation of the Job Status Change events, for example, if you want to register these events in the Data Index Service. Using environment variables Using system properties with java like names Variable Description Default value KOGITO_JOBS_SERVICE_HTTP_JOB_STATUS_CHANGE_EVENTS true to establish if the Job Status Change events must be propagated. If you set this value to true you must be sure that the sink binding was created. false Variable Description Default value kogito.jobs-service.http.job-status-change-events true to establish if the Job Status Change events must be propagated. If you set this value to true you must be sure that the sink binding was created. false To ensure the Job Service receives the Knative events to manage the jobs, you must create the create job events and delete job events triggers shown in the diagram below. Additionally, if you have enabled the Job Status Change events propagation you must create the sink binding. Figure 1. Knative eventing supporting resources The following snippets shows an example on how you can configure these resources. Consider that these configurations might need to be adjusted to your local kubernetes cluster. We recommend that you visit this example Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services to see a full setup of all these configurations.

Currently, the Job Service is a singleton service, and thus, just one active instance of the service can be scheduling and executing the jobs. To avoid issues when it is deployed in the cloud, where it is common to eventually have more than one instance deployed, the Job Service supports a leader instance election process. Only the instance that becomes the leader activates the external communication to receive and schedule jobs. All the instances that are not leaders, stay inactive in a wait state and try to become the leader continuously. When a new instance of the service is started, it is not set as a leader at startup time but instead, it starts the process to become one. When an instance that is the leader for any issue stays unresponsive or is shut down, one of the other running instances becomes the leader. Figure 2. Job Service leader election This leader election mechanism uses the underlying persistence backend, which currently is only supported in the PostgreSQL implementation. There is no need for any configuration to support this feature, the only requirement is to have the supported database with the data schema up-to-date as described in the Job Service PostgreSQL Configuration section. In case the underlying persistence does not support this feature, you must guarantee that just one single instance of the Job Service is running at the same time.

The Workflow runtime persistence, and Data Index persistence. Each mechanism is intended for a different purpose: The workflow runtime persistence ensures that your workflow instances remain consistent during an error or a runtime restart. For example, a pod restart, a programmed maintenance shutdown, etc. This is achieved by storing snapshots of the executing workflow instances [see more details]. That information is stored in an internal format, and usually, you must only focus on providing the proper configurations to use it. To learn how to configure it we recommend that you read the following sections depending on your use case: Using persistence in SonataFlow Operator managed workflow deployments Using persistence in advanced development cases of SonataFlow applications using Quarkus and Java In production environments, or when your workflows use timeouts, or you use operator managed knative serving deployments, it’s strongly recommended that you configure the workflow runtime persistence. The Data Index persistence is designed to store information about your workflow instances in a way that this information can be consumed by other services using GraphQL queries. This is achieved by properly configuring and deploying the Data Index Service in your installation. To learn how to configure and deploy the Data Index Service we recommend that you read the following sections depending on your use case: Deploying supporting services with SonataFlow Operator Data Index standalone service To learn more about this service, examine the links in additional resources.

For information about orchestrating and configuring the OpenAPI based services, you must see the following documents: Orchestrating the OpenAPI services Configuring the OpenAPI services endpoints The OpenAPI support for a workflow is based on the Quarkus OpenAPI generator extension. For more information about Quarkus OpenAPI generator, see Quarkus - OpenAPI Generator. According to the OpenAPI specification, you can secure an OpenAPI service operation by using a security scheme. These security schemes are defined in the Security Scheme Object definitions of the OpenAPI specification file. The security scheme type defined for an OpenAPI service operation is used to identify the required configuration, when a workflow invokes the same operation. The following shows the example of security scheme definitions: Example security-example.json file \"securitySchemes\": { \"http-basic-example\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"scheme\": \"basic\" } \"api-key-example\": { \"type\": \"apiKey\", \"name\": \"my-example-key\", \"in\": \"header\" } } If the OpenAPI specification file contains securitySchemes definitions, but not the Security Requirement Object definitions, the generator is configured to create the security requirement objects by default. In this case, for all the operations without a security requirement, the default one is created. Note that the property value must match the name of a security scheme object definition, such as http-basic-example or api-key-example in the previous securitySchemes list. Description Property key Example Create security for the referenced security scheme quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.default.security.scheme quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.default.security.scheme=http-basic-example To configure the credentials that are used to access the secured OpenAPI service operations and related parameters, you must use the application properties that are related to the security schemes. To compose the configuration keys, use the following format: Format for configuration keys quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].[auth_property_name] The previous format includes the following parameters: filename is the sanitized name of the file containing the OpenAPI specification, such as security_example_json. security_scheme_name is the sanitized name of the security scheme object definition in the OpenAPI specification file, such as http_basic_example or api_key_example. auth_property_name is the name of the property to configure, such as username. This property depends on the defined security scheme type. To sanitize the previous parameters, you can follow the Environment Variables Mapping Rules from Microprofile Configuration. In the mapping rules, any non-alphabetic character is replaced by an underscore (_). The security schemes defined in an OpenAPI specification file are global to all the operations that are available in the same file. This means that the configurations set for a particular security scheme also apply to the other secured operations. You can use the alternatives defined in the Quarkus configuration reference guide to configure the required properties. A common usage is to define environment variables to set the authentication secrets. For a complete example, see Orchestration of third-party services using OAuth 2.0 authentication. The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloBasic operation, which is secured using the http-basic-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for HTTP authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Http Basic Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-http-basic\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloBasic\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"http-basic-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"http-basic-example\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"scheme\": \"basic\" } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloBasic operation in the previous example: Table 1. Supported configuration examples for HTTP authentication Description Property key Example Username credentials quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].username quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_basic_example.username=MY_USER Password credentials quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].password quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_basic_example.password=MY_PASSWD The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloBearer operation, which is secured using the http-bearer-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for Bearer Token authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Http Bearer Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-http-bearer\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloBearer\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"http-bearer-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"http-bearer-example\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"scheme\": \"bearer\" } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloBearer operation in the previous example: Table 2. Supported configuration examples for Bearer Token authentication Description Property key Example Bearer Token quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].bearer-token quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_bearer_example.bearer-token=MY_TOKEN The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloApiKey operation, which is secured using the api-key-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for API key authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Api Key Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-api-key\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloApiKey\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"api-key-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"api-key-example\": { \"type\": \"apiKey\", \"name\": \"api-key-name\", \"in\": \"header\" } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloApiKey operation in the previous example: Table 3. Supported configuration examples for API key authentication Description Property key Example API Key quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].api-key quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.api_key_example.api-key=MY_KEY The API key scheme type contains an additional name property that configures the key name to use when the Open API service is invoked. Also, the format to pass the key depends on the value of the in property. When the value is header, the key is passed as an HTTP request parameter. When the value is cookie, the key is passed as an HTTP cookie. When the value is query, the key is passed as an HTTP query parameter. However, this is automatically managed without additional configurations. Following the previous example, the API key is passed as an http request parameter, such as api-key-name with the value MY_KEY. The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloOauth2 operation, which is secured using the oauth-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for OAuth 2.0 authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Oauth2 Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-oauth2\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloOauth2\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"oauth-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"oauth-example\": { \"type\": \"oauth2\", \"flows\": { \"clientCredentials\": { \"authorizationUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth/token\", \"scopes\": { } } } } } } } Unlike the http basic, http bearer, and apiKey security schemes, the OAuth 2.0 authentication relies on the Quarkus OpenId Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 Clients and Filters. Therefore, you must add the Quarkus OIDC Client Filter Extension to your project as shown in the following example: Example of adding Quarkus OIDC client filter extension io.quarkus quarkus-oidc-client-filter You can also add the Quarkus OIDC client filter extension using the Quarkus CLI as shown in the following example: Add Quarkus OIDC client filter extension $ quarkus extension add quarkus-oidc-client-filter The token management operations are delegated to a Quarkus OidcClient using a simple naming convention. In the previous example, the token management operations that are used to access the sayHelloOauth2 operation are delegated to the OidcClient that is oauth_example. You can configure the OidcClient as shown in the following example: Example of configuring an OidcClient quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.auth-server-url=https://example.com/oauth quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.token-path=/tokens quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.discovery-enabled=false quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.client-id=kogito-app quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.grant.type=client quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.credentials.client-secret.method=basic quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.credentials.client-secret.value=secret The suffix (quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example) used in the previous configuration example is exclusive for the security scheme defined in the OpenAPI service specification file and the scheme name is sanitized using the mapping rules. You can use the authorization token propagation with OpenAPI operations that are secured using the oauth2 or http bearer security scheme type. When the configuration is set, you can propagate the authorization tokens that are passed to your workflow during the workflow creation. The propagations must be configured individually for each security scheme, which enables you to configure the invocations that must propagate the token. Similar to other security scheme configurations, the token propagation applies to all the OpenAPI operations that are secured using the same security scheme. The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloOauth2 operation, which is secured using the oauth-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for authorization token propagation { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Oauth2 Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-oauth2\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloOauth2\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"oauth-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"oauth-example\": { \"type\": \"oauth2\", \"flows\": { \"clientCredentials\": { \"authorizationUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth/token\", \"scopes\": { } } } } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloOauth2 operation in the previous example: Table 4. Supported configuration examples for token propagation Property key Example quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].token-propagation=[true,false] quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.oauth_example.token-propagation=true Enables the token propagation for all the operations that are secured using the oauth-example scheme in the security-example.json file. By default, the standard HTTP authorization header is propagated. quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].header-name=[http_header_name] quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.oauth_example.header-name=MyHeaderName States that the authorization token is read from the MyHeaderName header instead of the standard HTTP authorization header. The authorization tokens are propagated till the workflow does not reach its waiting state. When the same workflow is resumed, the tokens will not be propagated.

For more information about orchestrating and configuring OpenAPI services, see Orchestrating the OpenAPI services, Configuring the OpenAPI services endpoints, and Authentication for OpenAPI services in SonataFlow. To understand the example of OAuth 2.0 orchestration in a workflow, you can use the serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application. This example application implements a workflow related to currency exchange calculations, which orchestrates an OAuth 2.0 secured REST service provided by Acme Financial Services. Suppose you have a set of applications that must resolve the currency exchange calculations as their regular operations, and to resolve the currency exchange calculations, you need to get the accurate exchange rates. For this purpose, you can use the Acme Financial Services. When you use the Acme Financial Services, you can query the exchange rates using their OAuth 2.0 secured services, which you can access using the granted credentials. However, you do not want to expose the services provided by Acme to the applications. In this case, you can implement a workflow that resolves the following aspects: Orchestration with services provided by Acme and currency exchange calculations. Authentication requirements to access the services provided by Acme. Potential vendor lock-in problems, in case you want to change the provider in the future. Domain-specific validations and optimizations. The further sections describes how an end-to-end solution is created in the serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application. To see the source code of serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application, you can clone the incubator-kie-kogito-examples repository in GitHub and select the serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus directory. The serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application contains the following services to compose the solution: currency-exchange-workflow: Workflow that implements the currency exchange calculations. acme-financial-service: REST service that provides the exchange rates. acme-oauth2-server: Keycloak server that secures the REST services from Acme Financial Services. The following figure describes the architecture of the solution in serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application: Figure 1. Example architecture diagram of the solution The application creates a workflow instance to calculate the currency exchange. The workflow executes an OpenAPI operation to get the exchange rates information. Authorizations are produced to validate the access. The workflow receives the exchange rates information and executes the calculations. The execution of workflow is finalized by sending the result to the application. The workflow automatically manages the interactions with the OAuth 2.0 server. Also, you must configure a Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC). For more information, see Configuration in serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application. currency-exchange-workflow The currency-exchange-workflow in serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application is a workflow that implements the currency exchange calculations. The following figure describes the workflow in currency-exchange-workflow: Figure 2. Example currency-exchange-workflow First, validate the input data. Check the validation results: If validation is successful, then transition to (3). If validation is unsuccessful, then no transition and finalize the workflow with the error execution status. Send REST request to acme-financial-service to retrieve the exchange rates: If the request is successful, then transition to (4). If the request is unsuccessful, then transition to (6). Calculate the currency exchange and transition to (5). Set the successful execution status and finalize the currency-exchange-workflow execution. Set the error execution status and finalize the currency-exchange-workflow execution. The following currency-exchange-workflow.sw.json file shows the specification of the currency-exchange-workflow: currency-exchange-workflow.sw.json file { \"id\": \"currency_exchange_workflow\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"name\": \"Currency Exchange SW\", \"dataInputSchema\": \"currency-exchange-workflow-schema.json\", \"start\": \"ValidateInputs\", \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"validateInputs\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"service:org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper::validateInputs\" }, { \"name\": \"getExchangeRate\", \"type\": \"rest\", \"operation\": \"specs/acme-financial-service.yml#exchangeRate\" }, { \"name\": \"calculateExchange\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \"${ { calculateExchangeResult: .amount * .exchangeRate } }\" } ], \"errors\": [ { \"name\": \"service_error\", \"code\": \"java.lang.Exception\" } ], \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"ValidateInputs\", (1) \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"validateInputsAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"validateInputs\", \"arguments\": { \"currencyFrom\": \"${ .currencyFrom }\", \"currencyTo\": \"${ .currencyTo }\", \"amount\": \"${ .amount }\", \"exchangeDate\": \"${ .exchangeDate }\" } } } ], \"transition\": \"CheckValidation\" }, { \"name\": \"CheckValidation\", (2) \"type\": \"switch\", \"dataConditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"${ .executionStatus == \\\"ERROR\\\" }\", \"end\": true } ], \"defaultCondition\": { \"transition\": \"GetExchangeRate\" } }, { \"name\": \"GetExchangeRate\", (3) \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"getExchangeRateAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"getExchangeRate\", \"arguments\": { \"currencyFrom\": \"${ .currencyFrom }\", \"currencyTo\": \"${ .currencyTo }\", \"exchangeDate\": \"${ .exchangeDate }\" } }, \"actionDataFilter\": { \"results\": \"${ {exchangeRate: .rate} }\" } } ], \"transition\": \"CalculateExchange\", \"onErrors\": [ { \"errorRef\": \"service_error\", \"transition\": \"EndWithError\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"CalculateExchange\", (4) \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"calculateExchangeAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"calculateExchange\" }, \"actionDataFilter\": { \"results\": \"${ {result: .calculateExchangeResult} }\" } } ], \"transition\": \"EndSuccessful\" }, { \"name\": \"EndWithError\", (5) \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"executionStatus\": \"ERROR\", \"executionStatusMessage\": \"Execution failed: The acme-financial-service invocation has failed, check that the service is running and that you have configured the OAuth2 client properly\" }, \"end\": true }, { \"name\": \"EndSuccessful\", (6) \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"executionStatus\": \"OK\", \"executionStatusMessage\": \"Execution successful\" }, \"end\": true } ] } 1 ValidateInputs state executes the validateInputs function to validate the input data. 2 CheckValidation state determines the next state to go by evaluating the validation results. 3 GetExchangeRate state executes the getExchangeRate function to retrieve the exchange rate from the remote server. 4 CalculateExchange state executes the calculateExchange function to calculate the currency exchange. 5 EndWithError state finalizes the workflow with an ERROR. 6 EndSuccessful state finalizes the workflow with successful OK status. The validateInputs function is used to execute the custom Java processing as part of the workflow. For more information about custom functions, see Serverless Workflow specification. The following is an example of validateInputs function definition: Example validateInputs function definition { \"name\": \"validateInputs\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"service:org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper::validateInputs\" (3) } 1 validateInputs function declaration. 2 custom type that enables you to use your own Java class to implement a function. 3 Specifies that the function is implemented by the method validateIntpus in the org.kie.kogito.examples.ExchangeWorkflowHelper Java class. To implement a custom function, you must create a Java class such as ExchangeWorkflowHelper in your project: Example ExchangeWorkflowHelper.java file package org.kie.kogito.examples; import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped; @ApplicationScoped public class ExchangeWorkflowHelper { public ValidationResult validateInputs(String currencyFrom, String currencyTo, double amount, String exchangeDate) { // Implement your custom Java processing here and return // a Java POJO to the Serverless Workflow. if (!good) { return new ValidationResult(\"ERROR\", \"Not good!\"); } return new ValidationResult(); } public static class ValidationResult { private String executionStatus; private String executionStatusMessage; // getters, setters, etc. } } To access the acme-financial-service REST service in currency-exchange-workflow, a workflow function such as getExchangeRate is used. For more information about using functions for REST services, see Serverless Workflow specification. Following is the function definition of getExchangeRate: Example getExchangeRate function definition { \"name\": \"getExchangeRate\", (1) \"type\": \"rest\", \"operation\": \"specs/acme-financial-service.yml#exchangeRate\" (2) } 1 getExchangeRate function declaration. 2 Specifies that the function is implemented by the exchangeRate operation in the acme-financial-service.yml file. For the previous configuration, the acme-financial-service.yml file must be located in the src/main/resources/specs directory of the project. In order to filter the information, which must be returned to the currency-exchange-workflow, an actionDataFilter is used: Example actionDataFilter to pass the getExchangeRate results \"actionDataFilter\": { \"results\": \"${ {exchangeRate: .rate} }\" (1) } 1 Merge the value of the rate property to the exchangeRate workflow data property. The value of the rate property is retrieved from the acme-financial-service invocation result. For more information about action data filters, see Action data filters in Serverless Workflow specification. To calculate the currency exchange rates in currency-exchange-workflow, a function named calculateExchange is used: Example calculateExchange function definition { \"name\": \"calculateExchange\", (1) \"type\": \"expression\", (2) \"operation\": \"${ { calculateExchangeResult: .amount * .exchangeRate } }\" (3) } 1 calculateExchange function declaration. 2 expression type that enables you to use an expression to implement a function. 3 Specifies that the function returns a JSON object with a calculateExchangeResult property, containing the calculation. For more information about using functions for expression evaluation, see Serverless Workflow specification. Similar to getExchangeRate to filter the information, which must be returned to the currency-exchange-workflow, an actionDataFilter is used: Example actionDataFilter to pass the calculateExchange results: \"actionDataFilter\": { \"results\": \"${ {result: .calculateExchangeResult} }\" (1) } 1 Merge the value of the calculateExchangeResult property to the result workflow data property. The value of the calculateExchangeResult property is retrieved from the expression result. acme-financial-service The acme-financial-service in serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application is a REST service that provides the exchange rates. Following is the OpenAPI specification that defines the acme-financial-service: Example acme-financial-service.yml OpenAPI specification --- openapi: 3.0.3 info: title: Acme Financial Service API version: 1.0.1 paths: /financial-service/exchange-rate: (1) get: tags: - Acme Financial Resource operationId: exchangeRate parameters: (2) - name: currencyFrom in: query schema: type: string - name: currencyTo in: query schema: type: string - name: exchangeDate in: query schema: type: string responses: (3) \"200\": description: OK content: (4) application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExchangeRateResult' security: - acme-financial-oauth: [ ] (5) components: schemas: ExchangeRateResult: (6) type: object properties: rate: format: double type: number securitySchemes: acme-financial-oauth: (7) type: oauth2 (8) flows: clientCredentials: (9) authorizationUrl: http://localhost:8281/auth/realms/kogito/protocol/openid-connect/auth tokenUrl: http://localhost:8281/auth/realms/kogito/protocol/openid-connect/token scopes: { } 1 REST path to access the exchangeRate operation in the remote server. 2 Parameter of the exchangeRate operation. 3 Responses of the exchangeRate operation. 4 Response type and data exchange format. 5 Specifies that the exchangeRate operation is secured using the acme-financial-oauth security scheme. 6 Response type specification. 7 Specification of the acme-financial-oauth security scheme. 8 Security scheme type. The security scheme type indicates that you must configure a Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC) using acme_financial_oauth name to execute the operation. 9 Authentication flow and related information.

The configuration for the workflow used in serverless-workflow-oauth2-orchestration-quarkus example application includes defining required properties in application.properties file as shown in the following example: Example application.properties file configuration quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.acme_financial_service_yml.base-package=com.acme (1) quarkus.rest-client.acme_financial_service_yml.url=http://localhost:8483 (2) quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.discovery-enabled=false (3) quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8281/auth/realms/kogito/protocol/openid-connect/auth (4) quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.token-path=http://localhost:8281/auth/realms/kogito/protocol/openid-connect/token (5) quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.client-id=kogito-app (6) quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.grant.type=client quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.credentials.client-secret.method=basic (7) quarkus.oidc-client.acme_financial_oauth.credentials.client-secret.value=secret (8) 1 Package name for automatically generated classes that implement the access to all operations defined in the acme-financial-service.yml file. 2 Root URL to access all operations defined in the acme-financial-service.yml file. For the exchangeRate operation, a URL such as http://localhost:8483/financial-service/exchange-rate is automatically generated. 3 Disables the OAuth 2.0 server endpoints discovery as the endpoints provided in the acme-financial-service-yml file are used instead. 4 Authentication URL of the OAuth 2.0 server. 5 Relative path or URL of the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint, which allocates access and refreshes tokens. 6 Client ID to identify the workflow against the authorization service, such as kogito-app. This identifier must be provided by Acme. 7 Method that is used at the time of sending the client-secret for the authentications when the client grant type is used. 8 client-secret to authenticate the workflow against the authorization service when the client grant type is used. This secret must be provided by Acme. To configure the Quarkus OpenId Connect Client (OIDC) for acme_financial_service_oauth service, you must follow the rules described in Example of OAuth 2.0 authentication. Also, the particular attributes depend on the OAuth 2.0 server and authorization flow to use. You can get the information about the OAuth 2.0 server and authorization flow from the acme-financial-service.yml file. Also, you can use the alternatives defined in the Quarkus configuration reference guide to configure the properties in application.properties file. You can define environment variables to set the authentication secrets, and you can use the Quarkus Credentials Provider framework.

SonataFlow leverages MicroProfile REST Client to invoke OpenAPI services. Therefore, you can configure the OpenAPI services by following the MicroProfile Config specification. For the list of properties to configure in the MicroProfile REST Client specification, see Support for MicroProfile Config in MicroProfile REST Client documentation. SonataFlow follows the strategy defined in the kogito.sw.operationIdStrategy property to generate the REST Client. The possible values of the kogito.sw.operationIdStrategy property include: FILE_NAME(Default value): SonataFlow uses the configuration key based on the OpenAPI document file name as shown in the following example: Example property quarkus.rest-client.stock_portfolio_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8282/ In the previous example, SonataFlow uses stock_portfolio_svc_yaml as configuration key as the OpenAPI document is available at src/main/resources/openapi/stock-portfolio-svc.yaml. FULL_URI: SonataFlow uses the full URI path as configuration key as shown in the following example: Example Serverless Workflow { \"id\": \"myworkflow\", \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myfunction\", \"operation\": \"https://my.remote.host/apicatalog/apis/123/document\" (1) } ] ... } 1 URI path of the OpenAPI document Example property quarkus.rest-client.apicatalog_apis_123_document.url=http://localhost:8282/ In the previous example, SonataFlow uses apicatalog_apis_123_document as configuration key. FUNCTION_NAME: SonataFlow uses the workflow ID and the function name that references the OpenAPI document as shown in the following examples: Example Serverless Workflow { \"id\": \"myworkflow\", \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myfunction\", \"operation\": \"https://my.remote.host/apicatalog/apis/123/document\" } ] ... } Example property quarkus.rest-client.myworkflow_myfunction.url=http://localhost:8282/ In the previous example, SonataFlow uses \"myworkflow_myfunction\" as configuration key.

Example property quarkus.rest-client.stock-service_API.url=http://localhost:8282/ In the previous example, SonataFlow uses stock-service_API as configuration key. A Kubernetes service endpoint can be used as a service URL if the target service is within the same cluster, such as http://myservice.mynamespace.cluster.svc.local. As an alternative to kogito.sw.operationIdStrategy, you can assign an alias name to a URI by using workflow-uri-definitions custom extension.

Prerequisites A workflow project is created. For more information about creating a workflow project, see Creating your first workflow project. You have installed the tooling. For more information about the tooling, see Getting familiar with SonataFlow tooling. SonataFlow follows the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification function definition to send requests to remote REST services using an OpenAPI specification reference as shown in the following example: Example of an OpenAPI function definition { \"functions\":[ { \"name\":\"myFunction1\", \"operation\":\"classpath:/myopenapi-file.yaml#myFunction1\" } ] } In the previous example function definition, the type attribute can be omitted as the default value is rest. In the previous example, the operation attribute is a string composed of the following parameters: URI that the engine uses to locate the specification file, such as classpath. Operation identifier. You can find the operation identifier in the OpenAPI specification file. SonataFlow supports the following URI schemes: classpath: This URI scheme is supported for the files that are located in the src/main/resources folder of the application project. The classpath is the default URI scheme. If you do not define a URI scheme as shown in the following examples, the file location is defined as src/main/resources/myopenapifile.yaml: /myopenapifile.yaml file: This URI scheme is supported for the files that are located in the file system. http or https: This URI scheme is supported for remotely located files. The OpenAPI specification files must be available during the build time, because SonataFlow leverages the internal code generation feature to send requests on runtime. Therefore, once you have built the application image, SonataFlow will not have access to the files. For more information about building workflow images, see Building workflow images using Quarkus CLI. To get started with orchestrating the OpenAPI based services, you must locate the REST services OpenAPI specification files. Usually, REST services expose their interface using the OpenAPI specification. For example, see the Petstore API. In case, the OpenAPI service that you want to add to the workflow does not contain a specification file, you can either create a specification file or update the OpenAPI service to generate and expose the file. There are various REST frameworks that support the OpenAPI specification generation, including: Java Quarkus - Using OpenAPI and Swagger UI Spring Boot Documentation Go Go Swagger Documentation Python Flasgger .NET ASP.NET Core web API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI TypeScript Swagger UI Express PHP swagger-php If you do not have access to the REST service, which is used to add the OpenAPI specification generator, you can use Swagger Inspector. The Swagger Inspector generates the specification file based on HTTP traffic. To send REST requests that are based on the OpenAPI specification files, you need to perform the following procedures: Define the function references Access the defined functions in the workflow states To send requests with the REST calls, first you need to define the OpenAPI functions. Prerequisites You have access to the OpenAPI specification files. Once you have access to the OpenAPI specification files, you can define the functions in the workflow. You can also use the serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application as a reference. Procedure Copy the OpenAPI specification files of the service(s) you want to invoke into your workflow service directory, which can be src/main/resources/specs. In the serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application, the services that are invoked include multiplication and subtraction services. The OpenAPI specification files in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application are extracted from the running multiplication and subtraction services. The REST Quarkus applications expose the related OpenAPI specification files using the Quarkus Swagger extension. Following is an example OpenAPI specification of the multiplication REST service: Example multiplication REST service OpenAPI specification openapi: 3.0.3 info: title: Generated API version: \"1.0\" paths: /: post: operationId: doOperation (1) parameters: - in: header name: notUsed schema: type: string required: false requestBody: content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/MultiplicationOperation' responses: \"200\": description: OK content: application/json: schema: type: object properties: product: format: float type: number components: schemas: MultiplicationOperation: (2) type: object properties: leftElement: format: float type: number rightElement: format: float type: number 1 operationId of the REST operation. The operationId in an OpenAPI specification is necessary to add a reference to the operation that you want to use in REST invocation. 2 Data structure of the REST operation. Use the same operationId to compose the final URI in the workflow function definition as shown in the following example: OpenAPI functions definition in the Temperature Conversion example { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"multiplication\", \"operation\": \"specs/multiplication.yaml#doOperation\" (1) }, { \"name\": \"subtraction\", \"operation\": \"specs/subtraction.yaml#doOperation\" (2) } ] } 1 Function definition for OpenAPI multiplication function 2 Function definition for OpenAPI subtraction function Note that in the previous example, the multiplication and subtraction OpenAPI files are stored in the src/main/resources/specs folder of the application. After defining the function definitions, you can access the defined functions in the workflow states. Prerequisites You have defined the OpenAPI functions in a workflow. For more information, see Defining OpenAPI functions in a workflow. Procedure Use a workflow action to call a function definition that you added. Any workflow action can call a function defined in the function definition. To map the arguments of a function, you can refer to the parameters described in the Operation Object section of OpenAPI specification. Also, the engine maps the parameter naming according to the OpenAPI specification. After that, you can use jq expressions to extract the payload data and map the data to the required parameters. In the following example, the parameters are part of the request body: Example of mapping a function arguments { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"SetConstants\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"subtractValue\": 32.0, \"multiplyValue\": 0.5556 }, \"transition\": \"Computation\" }, { \"name\": \"Computation\", \"actionMode\": \"sequential\", \"type\": \"operation\", (1) \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"subtract\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subtraction\", (2) \"arguments\": { (3) \"leftElement\": \".fahrenheit\", \"rightElement\": \".subtractValue\" } } }, { \"name\": \"multiply\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"multiplication\", (4) \"arguments\": { (5) \"leftElement\": \".difference\", \"rightElement\": \".multiplyValue\" } } } ], \"end\": { \"terminate\": \"true\" } } ] } 1 Operation State definition 2 Reference to the subtraction function 3 Definition of the subtraction function arguments 4 Reference to the multiplication function 5 Definition of the multiplication function arguments In the serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application, the functions are called sequentially in an Operation State as shown in the previous example. For more information about mapping parameters in the request path instead of request body, you can refer to the following PetStore API example: Example Petstore OpenAPI specification excerpt { \"/pet/{petId}\": { \"get\": { \"tags\": [ \"pet\" ], \"summary\": \"Find pet by ID\", \"description\": \"Returns a single pet\", \"operationId\": \"getPetById\", \"parameters\": [ { \"name\": \"petId\", \"in\": \"path\", \"description\": \"ID of pet to return\", \"required\": true, \"schema\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"format\": \"int64\" } } ] } } } Following is an example invocation of a function, in which only one parameter named petId is added in the request path: Example of calling the PetStore function { \"name\": \"CallPetStore\", (1) \"actionMode\": \"sequential\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"getPet\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"getPetById\", (2) \"arguments\": { (3) \"petId\": \".petId\" } } } ] } 1 State definition, such as CallPetStore. 2 Function definition reference. In the previous example, the function definition getPetById is for PetStore OpenAPI specification. 3 Arguments definition. In the previous example, SonataFlow adds the argument petId to the request path before sending a request. After accessing the function definitions in workflow states, you can configure the endpoint URL of OpenAPI services. SonataFlow uses the Quarkus OpenAPI Generator extension and the Quarkus REST Client, and all the configurations are based on these components, which are backed using Quarkus Configuration. Prerequisites You have defined the function definitions in the workflow. For more information, see Defining OpenAPI functions in a workflow. You have the access to the defined functions in the workflow states. For more information, see Accessing functions in the workflow states. Procedure To configure the endpoints, you must use the sanitized OpenAPI specification file name as the REST client configuration key. The configuration key must be set as a valid environment variable. For example, a file named as subtraction.yaml contains the configuration key as subtraction_yaml. For more information about how to sanitize file names, see Environment Variables Mapping Rules. You can use the same configuration key on each property that is related to the Quarkus REST client as shown in the following URL configuration example: Example of URL configuration quarkus.rest-client.subtraction_yaml.url=http://myserver.com To avoid hardcoding the URL in the application.properties file, you can use environment variables substitution, as shown in the following example: Example of URL configuration with environment variables quarkus.rest-client.subtraction_yaml.url=${SUBTRACTION_URL:http://myserver.com} In case the environment variable SUBTRACTION_URL is not found in the previous example, the URL redirects to http://myserver.com. You can also use environment variables to configure the application in Kubernetes environments, in which variables can be injected into the pod of the application. For more information about endpoints and general configuration, see Configuring the OpenAPI services endpoints. In a future release, SonataFlow will provide support for Kubernetes Service Discovery feature. Using the Kubernetes Service Discovery feature, you can point to a Kubernetes or Knative object that you want to call. After that, the engine will automatically configure the endpoints once you deploy the endpoints in the cluster.

Also, it covers the difference between OpenAPI Callback and the Serverless Workflow Callback state. The Serverless Workflow callback state can be implemented using both the OpenAPI callback and the Callback state functionalities. Both the functionalities perform an action and wait for an event to be produced as a result of the action to resume the workflow, but each of them follows a different approach in achieving it. Therefore, both OpenAPI callback and the Callback state approaches are suitable to perform fire & wait-for-result operations. The OpenAPI callback is an asynchronous, out-of-band request that your service will send to some other service in response to specific events. In contrast, the Callback state performs an action that triggers an external activity/service which is responsible for sending a cloud event to the workflow. Both ways aim to send an event to the workflow to resume the flow. As mentioned in the OpenAPI Callback document, when the workflow makes an asynchronous service call, you must provide the callback URL in the request body. The external service invokes the callback URL and sends a CloudEvent to the workflow. From a workflow perspective, asynchronous service indicates that the control is returned to the caller immediately without waiting for the action to be completed. Once the action is completed, a CloudEvent needs to be published to resume the workflow. For the workflow to identify the published CloudEvent it is waiting for, the external service developer includes the workflow instance ID in the CloudEvent header or uses the Event correlation. The following figure displays the process: The workflow correlation described in this document focuses on the former mechanism that is based on the fact that each workflow instance contains a unique identifier, which is generated automatically.

After installing the SonataFlow plugin, you can use the quarkus create command with kn workflow to scaffold a new Quarkus Workflow project in your current directory. The quarkus create command sets up a SonataFlow Quarkus project containing minimal extensions to build a workflow project. Also, the generated workflow project contains a \"hello world\" workflow.sw.json file in your .//src/main/resources directory. Prerequisites SonataFlow plugin for Knative CLI is installed. For more information about installing the plugin, see Installing the SonataFlow plugin for Knative CLI. You have set up your environment according to the advanced environment setup guide. Procedure Enter the following command to create a new project: Creates a project named new-project kn workflow quarkus create By default, the generated project is named as new-project. You can overwrite the project name by using the [-n|--name] flag as follows: Create a project named my-project kn workflow quarkus create --name my-project Add more extensions to the Quarkus project during its creation by using the [-e|--extension] flag as follows: Create a project with quarkus-jsonp and quarkus-smallrye-openapi extensions kn workflow quarkus create --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi You can add multiple extensions using the comma-separated names of the extensions in the previous command. When you run the create command for the first time, it might take a while due to the necessity of downloading the required dependencies for the Quarkus project. For more options with quarkus create command use [-h|--help]. After creating your workflow project, you can use the quarkus build command with kn workflow to build your workflow project in your current directory and to generate a container image. The process of building your workflow project produces a knative.yml file in the ./target/kubernetes folder. If your workflow contains events, then the building process also generates a kogito.yml file. Prerequisites SonataFlow plugin for Knative CLI is installed. For more information about installing the plugin, see Installing the SonataFlow plugin for Knative CLI. You have set up your environment according to the advanced environment setup guide. A workflow project is created. For more information about creating a workflow project, see Creating workflow project using Knative CLI. Procedure Enter the following command to build your workflow project: Build the project and generate a local image named dev.local/my-project kn workflow quarkus build --image dev.local/my-project By using dev.local as repository, you can deploy your SonataFlow project in a local environment without having to push the image to a container registry. To use the quarkus build command, you need to provide either the --image or --image-name flag. In the previous command, you can use the [-i|--image] in several ways, such as: --image=[name] --image=[name]:[tag] --image=[repository]/[name] --image=[repository]/[name]:[tag] --image=[registry]/[repository]/[name] --image=[registry]/[repository]/[name]:[tag] The default value for registry and tag is quay.io and latest respectively. Also, you can use specific flags to compose the full name of the image as follows: --image-registry --image-repository --image-name --image-tag In case the --image flag is composed with specific flags as shown in the following command, then the specific value overrides the --image flag: Build the project and generate a local image named quay.io/other-user/my-project:1.0.1 kn workflow quarkus build --image my-user/my-project:1.0.0 --image-repository other-user --image-tag 1.0.1 You can use the following strategies to build a workflow project and to generate the container image: Using Jib Jib is an extension that builds a container image without the necessity of a container runtime. When using the Jib extension, the rebuilds are fast and the resultant container image is optimized. You can use the following commands to build a workflow project and to generate a local image using Jib: Build a project and generate a local image using Jib kn workflow quarkus build --image dev.local/my-project --jib The generated container image can be saved in the Docker runtime. Build a project and generate a local image using Jib kn workflow quarkus build --image dev.local/my-project --jib-podman Using the previous command, the generated container image can be saved in the Podman runtime. If you do not want to use any container runtime, then use --push to push the generated container image to the respective registry as shown in the following command: Build a project and push the image using Jib kn workflow quarkus build --image my-project --jib --push Before using the --push option, ensure that you have access to your registry. You can get the access using Docker or Podman login. Using Docker The process of building your workflow project using Docker is straightforward and also a default approach. When using Docker, you can automatically push the container image to the respective registry by using the --push option as shown in the following command: Build a project and push the image using Docker kn workflow quarkus build --image my-project --push For more options with quarkus build command use [-h|--help]. You can use the quarkus deploy command combined with kn workflow to deploy your workflow project in your current directory. However, before deploying the project, you must build your workflow project as the build process produces deployment files, such as knative.yml and kogito.yml (In case of events) in the ./target/kubernetes folder.

If you’re working with containers running Java applications and need to add a CA (Certificate Authority) certificate for secure communication this guide will explain the necesarry steps to setup CA for your workflow application. The guide assumes you are familiar with containers and have basic knowledge of working with YAML files. If you have a containerized Java application that connects to an SSL endpoint with a certificate signed by an internal authority (like SSL terminated routes on a cluster), you need to make sure Java can read and verify the CA Authority certificate. Java unfortunately doesn’t load certificates directly but rather stores them in a keystore. The default trust store under $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts contains only CA’s that are shipped with the Java distribution and there is the keytool tool that knows how to manipulate those key stores. The containerized application may not know the CA certificate in build time, so we need to add it to the trust-store in deployment. To automate that we can use a combination of an init-container and a shared directory to pass the mutated trust store to the container before it runs. Let’s run this step by step: Before proceeding, ensure you have the CA certificate file (in PEM format) that you want to add to the Java container. If you don’t have it, you may need to obtain it from your system administrator or certificate provider. For this guide, we are using the k8s cluster root CA that is automatically deployed into every container under /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt Add or amend these volumes and init-container snippet to your pod spec or podTemplate in a deployment: --- spec: volumes: - name: new-cacerts emptyDir: {} initContainers: - name: add-kube-root-ca-to-cacerts image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17 volumeMounts: - mountPath: /opt/new-cacerts name: new-cacerts command: - /bin/bash - -c - | cp $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts /opt/new-cacerts/ chmod +w /opt/new-cacerts/cacerts keytool -importcert -no-prompt -keystore /opt/new-cacerts/cacerts -storepass changeit -file /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt --- The default keystore under $JAVA_HOME is part of the container image and is not mutable. We have to create the mutated copy to a shared volume, hence the 'new-cacerts' one. Here you can mount the new, modified cacerts into the default location where the JVM looks. The Main.java example uses the standard HTTP client so alternatively you could mount the cacerts to a different location and configure the Java runtime to load the new keystore with a -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore system property. Note that libraries like RESTEasy don’t respect that flag and may need to programmatically set the trust store location. --- containers: - command: - /bin/bash - -c - | curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rgolangh/b949d8617709d10ba6c690863e52f259/raw/bdea4d757a05b75935bbb57f3f05635f13927b34/Main.java -o curl.java java curl.java https://kubernetes image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17 imagePullPolicy: Always name: openjdk-17 volumeMounts: - mountPath: /lib/jvm/java-17/lib/security name: new-cacerts readOnly: true - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount name: kube-api-access-5npmd readOnly: true --- Notice the volume mount of the previously mutated keystore. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: root-ca-to-cacerts spec: initContainers: - name: add-kube-root-ca-to-cacerts image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17 volumeMounts: - mountPath: /opt/new-cacerts name: new-cacerts command: - /bin/bash - -c - | cp $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts /opt/new-cacerts/ chmod +w /opt/new-cacerts/cacerts keytool -importcert -no-prompt -keystore /opt/new-cacerts/cacerts -storepass changeit -file /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt containers: - command: - /bin/bash - -c - | curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rgolangh/b949d8617709d10ba6c690863e52f259/raw/bdea4d757a05b75935bbb57f3f05635f13927b34/Main.java -o curl.java java curl.java https://kubernetes image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17 imagePullPolicy: Always name: openjdk-17 volumeMounts: - mountPath: /lib/jvm/java-17/lib/security/ name: new-cacerts readOnly: true - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount name: kube-api-access-5npmd readOnly: true volumes: - name: new-cacerts emptyDir: {} - name: kube-api-access-5npmd projected: sources: - serviceAccountToken: path: token - configMap: items: - key: ca.crt path: ca.crt name: kube-root-ca.crt --- Similar to a deployment spec, a serverless workflow has a spec.podTemplate, with minor differences, but the change is almost identical.

Every time you need to change the workflow definition the system will (re)build a new immutable version of the workflow. If you’re still in development phase, please see the Developing Workflows with the Operator guide. The build system implemented by the SonataFlow Operator is not suitable for complex production use cases. Consider using an external tool to build your application such as Tekton and ArgoCD. The resulting image can then be deployed with SonataFlow custom resource. More details available at Setting a custom image in the default container section of the Customize the PodSpec Definition guide. Follow the Kubernetes or OpenShift sections of this document based on the cluster you wish to build your workflows on. Prerequisites A Workflow definition. The SonataFlow Operator installed. See Install the SonataFlow Operator guide. The operator can build workflows on Kubernetes or OpenShift. On Kubernetes, it uses Kaniko and on OpenShift a standard BuildConfig. The operator build system is not tailored for advanced production use cases and you can do only a few customizations. If your scenario has strict policies for image usage, such as security or hardening constraints, you can replace the default image used by the operator to build the final workflow container image. Alternatively, you might want to test a nightly build with a bug fix or a custom image containing your customizations. By default, the operator will use the image distributed upstream to build workflows. You can change this image by editing the SonataFlowPlatform custom resource in the namespace where you deployed your workflows: Patching the current SonataFlowPlatform with the new builder image # use `kubectl get sonataflowplatform` to get the SonataFlowPlatform name kubectl patch sonataflowplatform --patch 'spec:\\n build:\\n config:\\n baseImage: ' -n The operator uses the ConfigMap named sonataflow-operator-builder-config in the operator’s installation namespace (sonataflow-operator-system) to configure and run the workflow build process. You can change the Dockerfile entry in this ConfigMap to tailor the Dockerfile to your needs. Just be aware that this can break the build process. Example of the sonataflow-operator-builder-config ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 data: DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_EXTENSION: .sw.json Dockerfile: \"FROM docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-sonataflow-builder:10.0.x AS builder\\n\\n# variables that can be overridden by the builder\\n# To add a Quarkus extension to your application\\nARG QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS\\n# Args to pass to the Quarkus CLI add extension command\\nARG QUARKUS_ADD_EXTENSION_ARGS\\n# Additional java/mvn arguments to pass to the builder\\nARG MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND\\n\\n# Copy from build context to skeleton resources project\\nCOPY --chown=1001 . ./resources\\n\\nRUN /home/kogito/launch/build-app.sh ./resources\\n \\n#=============================\\n# Runtime Run\\n#=============================\\nFROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-17:latest\\n\\nENV LANG='en_US.UTF-8' LANGUAGE='en_US:en'\\n \\ \\n# We make four distinct layers so if there are application changes the library layers can be re-used\\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=185 /home/kogito/serverless-workflow-project/target/quarkus-app/lib/ /deployments/lib/\\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=185 /home/kogito/serverless-workflow-project/target/quarkus-app/*.jar /deployments/\\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=185 /home/kogito/serverless-workflow-project/target/quarkus-app/app/ /deployments/app/\\nCOPY --from=builder --chown=185 /home/kogito/serverless-workflow-project/target/quarkus-app/quarkus/ /deployments/quarkus/\\n\\nEXPOSE 8080\\nUSER 185\\nENV AB_JOLOKIA_OFF=\\\"\\\"\\nENV JAVA_OPTS=\\\"-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0 -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager\\\"\\nENV JAVA_APP_JAR=\\\"/deployments/quarkus-run.jar\\\"\\n\" kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: sonataflow-operator-builder-config namespace: sonataflow-operator-system The excerpt above is just an example. The current version might have a slightly different version. Don’t use this example in your installation. You can create or edit a SonataFlowPlatform in the workflow namespace specifying the resources requirements for the internal builder pods: Example of SonataFlowPlatform apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: build: template: resources: requests: memory: \"64Mi\" cpu: \"250m\" limits: memory: \"128Mi\" cpu: \"500m\" Every build process will reuse this configuration and start new instances based on it from now on. Only one SonataFlowPlatform is allowed per namespace. Try fetching the one the operator created for you and edit it instead of trying to create another one. You can fine tune the resources requirements for a particular workflow. Every workflow instance will have a SonataFlowBuild instance created with the same name as the workflow. You can edit the SonataFlowBuild custom resource and specify the same parameters. For example: Example of SonataFlowBuild apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowBuild metadata: name: my-workflow spec: resources: requests: memory: \"64Mi\" cpu: \"250m\" limits: memory: \"128Mi\" cpu: \"500m\" This parameters will only apply to new build instances. You can pass build arguments (see Dockerfile ARG) to the SonataFlowBuild instance. Procedure Create or edit an existing SonataFlowBuild instance. It has the same name of the SonataFlow you’re trying to build. Checking if the SonataFlowBuild instance already exists kubectl edit sonataflowbuild/ -n Add to the .spec.buildArgs the desired arguments. Adding buildArgs to the SonataFlowBuild instance apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowBuild metadata: name: spec: [...] buildArgs: - name: ARG1 value: value1 - name: ARG2 value: value2 Save the file and exit. A new build should start soon with the new configuration. Alternatively, you can set this information in the SonataFlowPlatform, so that every new build instance will use it as a template. For example: Example of a SonataFlowPlatform instance with default build args for every build within the namespace apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: spec: build: template: buildArgs: - name: ARG1 value: value1 - name: ARG2 value: value2 Since the buildArgs attribute is an array of Kubernetes EnvVar object, you can refer to a ConfigMap or Secret to pass this value, for example. You’re not restricted by a plain value. On Minikube and Kubernetes only plain values, ConfigMap and Secret are supported due to a restriction on the build system provided by these platforms. The table below lists the Dockerfile arguments available in the default SonataFlow Operator installation: Table 1. Default ARG definitions in the builder Dockerfile Argument Description Example QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS List of Quarkus Extensions separated by comma that the builder should add to the workflow. org.kie:kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc:10.0.0 QUARKUS_ADD_EXTENSION_ARGS Arguments passed to the Quarkus CLI when adding extensions. Enabled only when QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS is not empty. See the Quarkus CLI documentation MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND Arguments passed to the maven build when the workflow build is produced. -Dkogito.persistence.type=jdbc -Dquarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql You can set environment variables to the SonataFlowBuild internal builder pod. This is useful in cases where you would like to influence only the build of the workflow. These environment variables are valid for the build context only. They are not set on the final built workflow image. Procedure Create or edit an existing SonataFlowBuild instance. It has the same name of the SonataFlow you’re trying to build. Checking if the SonataFlowBuild instance already exists kubectl edit sonataflowbuild/ -n Add to the .spec.envs the desired data. Setting environment variables in the SonataFlowBuild instance apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowBuild metadata: name: spec: [...] envs: - name: MYENV1 value: value1 - name: MYENV2 value: value2 Save the file and exit. A new build should start soon with the new configuration. Alternatively, you can set this information in the SonataFlowPlatform, so that every new build instances will use it as a template. For example: Example of a SonataFlowPlatform instance with default envs for every build within the namespace apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: spec: build: template: envs: - name: MYENV1 value: value1 - name: MYENV2 value: value2 Since the envs attribute is an array of Kubernetes EnvVar object, you can refer to a ConfigMap or Secret to pass this value, for example. You’re not restricted by a plain value. On Minikube and Kubernetes only plain values, ConfigMap and Secret are supported due to a restriction on the build system provided by these platforms. You can skip this section if you’re running on OpenShift. Follow these steps to configure your Kubernetes namespace to build workflow images with the operator. Create a new namespace that will hold all the resources that the operator will create (Pods, Deployments, Services, Secrets, ConfigMap, and Custom Resources) in this guide. Create a Namespace for the workflow to build and run in kubectl create namespace workflows # set the workflows namespace to your context kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=workflows You can follow these steps to publish on external registry that requires authentication. If you’re running on Minikube, just enable the internal registry. You can skip this whole section since the internal Minikube registry doesn’t require authentication. Create a secret for the container registry authentication kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server= --docker-username= --docker-password= --docker-email= -n workflows or you can directly import your local Docker config into your Kubernetes cluster: Create a Secret for the container registry authentication based on local Docker config kubectl create secret generic regcred --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=${HOME}/.docker/config.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson -n workflows Double-check your ${HOME}/.docker/config.json. If you’re using local desktop authentication, this configuration won’t work in the cluster. You can initialize this by logging in to the target registry, e.g. docker login. The SonataFlowPlatform is the Custom Resource used to control the behavior of the SonataFlow Operator. It defines the behavior of the operator when handling all SonataFlow Custom Resources (Workflow and Build) in the given namespace. Since the operator is installed in global mode, you will need to specify a SonataFlowPlatform in each Namespace where you want to deploy Workflows. If you have deployed a workflow for development you already have a SonataFlowPlatform custom resource since the operator created one for you. Just edit the one you have. Following is a very basic SonataFlowPlatform Custom Resource example to work on Kubernetes: Example of a basic SonataFlowPlatform on Kubernetes apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: build: config: strategyOptions: KanikoBuildCacheEnabled: \"true\" registry: address: docker.io (1) secret: regcred (2) 1 Your registry address 2 The secret name created in the steps above On Minikube, you can remove the registry information entirely since you don’t need credentials for pushing to the internal registry: Example of a basic SonataFlowPlatform on Minikube apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: build: config: strategyOptions: KanikoBuildCacheEnabled: \"true\" The spec.build.config.strategyOptions.KanikoBuildCacheEnabled enables the internal Kaniko process to cache builder images to try to speed up the building execution. The minikube registry addon must be enabled as follows. minikube addons enable registry To verify that the addon was property enabled: minikube addons list |grep registry | registry | minikube | enabled ✅ | minikube | | registry-aliases | minikube | disabled | 3rd party (unknown) | | registry-creds | minikube | disabled | 3rd party (UPMC Enterprises) | You can save this file locally and run the following command: Create a SonataFlowPlatform kubectl apply -f my-sonataflowplatform.yaml -n workflows You can also update \"on-the-fly\" the SonataFlowPlatform registry field with this command (change ) Create a SonataFlowPlatform with a specific registry cat my-sonataflowplatform.yaml | sed \"s|address: .*|address: \" | kubectl apply -f - You don’t need to do anything to build on OpenShift since the operator will configure everything for you. There are a few customizations you can do described in the [configure-build-system] section. In general, the operator will create a BuildConfig to build the workflow using the mapped resource files and your workflow definition. After the build is finished, the image will be pushed to the internal OpenShift registry backed by an ImageStream object. If you are running on OpenShift, you have access to the Red Hat’s supported registry. You can change the default builder image by editing the sonataflow-operator-builder-config ConfigMap. kubectl edit cm/sonataflow-operator-builder-config -n sonataflow-operator-system In your editor, change the first line in the Dockerfile entry where it reads FROM quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-swf-builder-nightly:latest to the desired image. This image must be compatible with your operator’s installation. You can now send your workflow definition (SonataFlow) to the operator. You can find a basic SonataFlow bellow: Example of the greetings workflow example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: greeting annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Greeting example on k8s! sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 spec: flow: start: ChooseOnLanguage functions: - name: greetFunction type: custom operation: sysout states: - name: ChooseOnLanguage type: switch dataConditions: - condition: \"${ .language == \\\"English\\\" }\" transition: GreetInEnglish - condition: \"${ .language == \\\"Spanish\\\" }\" transition: GreetInSpanish defaultCondition: GreetInEnglish - name: GreetInEnglish type: inject data: greeting: \"Hello from JSON Workflow, \" transition: GreetPerson - name: GreetInSpanish type: inject data: greeting: \"Saludos desde JSON Workflow, \" transition: GreetPerson - name: GreetPerson type: operation actions: - name: greetAction functionRef: refName: greetFunction arguments: message: \".greeting+.name\" end: true Save a file in your local file system with this content named greetings-workflow.yaml then run: kubectl apply -f greetings-workflow.yaml -n workflows You can check the logs of the build of your Workflow via: Get the Workflow pod logs # on Kubernetes kubectl logs kogito-greeting-builder -n workflows # on OpenShift oc logs buildconfig/greeting -n workflows The final pushed image must be printed into the logs at the end of the build. In order to check that the SonataFlow Greeting is up and running, you can try to perform a test HTTP call, from the greeting Pod. Procedure Expose the workflow so you can access it: Exposing the greeting workflow on Minikube # On Minikube you can use Nodeport kubectl patch svc greeting -n workflows -p '{\"spec\": {\"type\": \"NodePort\"}}' GREETING_SVC=$(minikube service greeting -n workflows --url) Exposing the greeting workflow on OpenShift # On OpenShift you can expose a route: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/networking/routes/route-configuration.html#nw-creating-a-route_route-configuration oc expose svc greeting -n workflows # get the public URL GREETING_SVC=$(oc get route/greeting --template='{{.spec.host}}') Make the HTTP call using curl: Check if the greeting workflow is running curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{\"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\"}' $GREETING_SVC/greeting If everything is working, you should receive a response like this: Response from the greeting workflow {\"id\":\"b5fbfaa3-b125-4e6c-9311-fe5a3577efdd\",\"workflowdata\":{\"name\":\"John\",\"language\":\"English\",\"greeting\":\"Hello from JSON Workflow, \"}} If you require to restart the build for some reason, you can add or edit the annotation sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true in the SonataFlowBuild instance. For example: Example of a SonataFlowBuild marked to restart apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowBuild metadata: name: greeting annotations: sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true After editing the resource, the operator will start a new build of the workflow. Once this is finished, the workflow will be notified and updated accordingly. If the build fails, but the workflow has a working deployment, the operator won’t roll out a new deployment. Ideally you should use this feature if there’s a problem with your workflow or the initial build revision.

The content of this guide must be used only when you work with workflows using the preview and gitops profiles. To produce a successful configuration you must follow this procedure: The SonataFlow Operator is installed. See Install the SonataFlow Operator guide.

In general, the following events are produced in a SonataFlow installation: Workflow outgoing and incoming business events. SonataFlow system events sent from the workflow to the Data Index and Job Service respectively. SonataFlow system events sent from the Jobs Service to the Data Index Service. The SonataFlow Operator is designed to use the Knative Eventing system to resolve all the event communication between these services. In a regular SonataFlow installation, the preferred method is to use the Platform-scoped Eventing system configuration, while the Workflow-scoped Eventing system configuration is reserved only for advanced use cases. To configure a platform-scoped eventing system, you must use the field spec.eventing.broker.ref in the SonataFlowPlatform CR to refer to a Knative Eventing broker. This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link every workflow deployed in that namespace, with the preview or gitops profile, to produce and consume the events by using that Broker. Additionally, the supporting services deployed in that namespace, that do not provide a custom eventing system configuration, will be linked to that broker. For more information about configuring the supporting services eventing system, see. The following SonataFlowPlatform CR fragment shows an example of such configuration: Platform scoped eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example namespace: example-namespace spec: eventing: broker: ref: name: example-broker (1) namespace: example-broker-namespace (2) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker 1 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker. 2 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform namespace. We recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlowPlatform. In production environments, you must use a production-ready broker, like the Knative Kafka Broker. A workflow-scoped eventing system configuration provides the ability to do a fine-grained configuration of the eventing system for the events produced and consumed by a workflow. To configure a workflow-scoped eventing system you must use the fields spec.sink.ref and spec.sources[] in the SonataFlow CR. To configure a workflow-scoped eventing system for the workflow outgoing events, you must use the field spec.sink.ref in the SonataFlow CR. This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link the current workflow, to produce the events by using that Broker. That includes, the SonataFlow system events, and the workflow business events. The following SonataFlow CR fragment shows an example of such configuration: Workflow-scoped outgoing eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: example-workflow namespace: example-workflow-namespace annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Example Workflow sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 sonataflow.org/profile: preview spec: sink: ref: name: outgoing-example-broker (1) namespace: outgoing-example-broker-namespace (2) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker flow: (3) start: ExampleStartState events: (4) - name: outEvent1 (5) source: '' kind: produced type: out-event-type1 (6) ... (7) 1 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker to use for all the events produced by the workflow, including the SonataFlow system events. 2 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlow namespace. We recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlow. 3 Flow definition field in the SonataFlow CR. 4 Events definition field in the SonataFlow CR. 5 Example of an outgoing event outEvent1 definition. 6 Event type for the outgoing event outEvent1 7 Only a fragment of the workflow is shown for simplicity. To configure a workflow-scoped eventing system for the workflow incoming events, you must use the field spec.sources[] in the SonataFlow CR. And, you must add an entry in the array, for every event type that requires an individual configuration. This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link the current workflow, to potentially consume the events from different Brokers, depending on the event type. Incoming event types not configured with a particular Broker, are consumed by applying Eventing system configuration precedence rules. The following SonataFlow CR fragment shows an example of such configuration: Workflow-scoped incoming eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: example-workflow namespace: example-workflow-namespace annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Example Workflow sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 sonataflow.org/profile: preview spec: sources: - eventType: in-event-type1 (1) ref: name: incoming-example-broker1 (2) namespace: incoming-example-broker1-namespace (3) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker - eventType: in-event-type2 (4) ref: name: incoming-example-broker2 (5) namespace: incoming-example-broker2-namespace (6) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker flow: (7) start: ExampleStartState events: (8) - name: inEvent1 (9) source: '' kind: consumed type: in-event-type1 (10) - name: inEvent2 (11) source: '' kind: consumed type: in-event-type2 (12) ... (13) 1 Eventing system configuration entry for the workflow incoming events of type in-event-type1. 2 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker to use for the consumption of the events of type in-event-type1 sent to this workflow. 3 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlow namespace. We recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlow. 4 Eventing system configuration entry for the workflow incoming events of type in-event-type2. 5 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker to use for the consumption of the events of type in-event-type2 sent to this workflow. 6 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlow namespace. We recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlow. 7 Flow definition field in the SonataFlow CR. 8 Events definition field in the SonataFlow CR. 9 Example of an incoming event inEvent1 definition. 10 Event type for the incoming event inEvent1. The link of the workflow event, with the corresponding spec.sources[] entry, is by using the event type name in-event-type1. 11 Example of an incoming event inEvent2 definition. 12 Event type for the incoming event inEvent2. The link of the workflow event, with the corresponding spec.sources[] entry, is by using the event type name in-event-type2. 13 Only a fragment of the workflow is shown for simplicity. Remember that the link between a spec.sources[] entry and the workflow event, is by using the event type. Incoming events without a corresponding spec.sources[] entry are consumed by applying the Eventing system configuration precedence rules. When you use a SonataFlowClusterPlatform, the workflows are automatically linked to the Broker configured in the SonataFlowPlatform CR referred to by the given SonataFlowClusterPlatform CR, according to the Eventing system configuration precedence rules. To configure the eventing system for a workflow, the SonataFlow Operator use the following precedence rules: If the workflow has a configured eventing system, by using any of the workflow-scoped outgoing eventing system or workflow-scoped incoming eventing system configurations, that configuration applies. If the SonataFlowPlatform CR enclosing the workflow, is configured with a platform-scoped eventing system, that configuration applies. If the current cluster, is configured with a cluster-scoped eventing system, that configuration apply. If none of the previous configurations exists, the workflow is configured to: Produce direct HTTP calls to deliver the SonataFlow system events to the supporting services. Consume the workflow incoming events in the workflow service root path / via HTTP POST calls. No eventing system is configured to produce the workflow business events, and thus, an attempt to produce such event will fail. The linking of the workflow with the eventing system is produced by using Knative Eventing SinkBindings and Triggers. These objects are automatically created by the SonataFlow Operator, and facilitate workflow events production and consumption. The following example shows the Knative Eventing objects created for an example-workflow configured with a platform-scoped eventing system.

When the operator deploys the Workflow service, it also creates two `ConfigMap`s to store the runtime properties: The user properties are defined in a ConfigMap named after the SonataFlow object with the suffix -props. For example, if your Workflow name is greeting, then the ConfigMap name is greeting-props. The Managed Properties are defined in a ConfigMap named after the SonataFlow object with the suffix -managed-props. For example, if your Workflow name is greeting, then the ConfigMap name is greeting-managed-props. Managed properties always override any user property using the same key name and cannot be edited by the user. Any change would be overwritten by the operator at the next reconciliation cycle. You can use the Kubernetes object editor of your preference to add or edit the properties in the Workflow configuration. Using kubectl you can do: Editing the Workflow Properties kubectl edit cm -props Note that it’s important to respect the properties format, otherwise the operator will replace your configuration with the default one. Here’s an example of a Workflow properties stored within a ConfigMap: Example of a Workflow ConfigMap Properties apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: app: greeting name: greeting-props namespace: default data: application.properties: | my.properties.key = any-value The underlying runtime engine that executes the Workflow service is based on Quarkus. The application.properties key in the ConfigMap means that you can configure the Workflow as you would any Quarkus application. Any SonataFlow configuration that the documentation describes or general Quarkus application property can be configured using this method. A few properties cannot be changed in this configuration and they are defined in the managed properties file. The table below lists them. Table 1. List of managed properties Property Key Immutable Value Profile quarkus.http.port 8080 all quarkus.http.host 0.0.0.0 all org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.health-enabled false dev Other managed properties include: The Kubernetes service discovery properties The Data Index location properties The Job Service location properties If you try to change any of them, the operator will override them with the default, but preserving your changes in other property keys. It’s possible to set custom global managed properties for your workflows by defining them in the SonataFlowPlatform resource in the same namespace. Edit the SonataFlowPlatform instance and add the required properties to the .spec.properties.flow attribute. For example: Example of a SonataFlowPlatform with flow properties apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: properties: flow: (1) - name: quarkus.log.category (2) value: INFO (3) 1 Attribute to set the array of custom global managed properties 2 The property key 3 The property value Every workflow in this SonataFlowPlatform instance’s namespace will have the property quarkus.log.category: INFO added to its managed properties. You can’t override the default managed properties set by the operator using this feature. You can add properties from other ConfigMap or Secret from the same namespace. For example: Example of a SonataFlowPlatform properties from ConfigMap and Secret apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: properties: flow: - name: my.petstore.auth.token valueFrom: (1) secretKeyRef: petstore-credentials keyName: AUTH_TOKEN - name: my.petstore.url valueFrom: configMapRef: petstore-props keyName: PETSTORE_URL 1 The valueFrom attribute derives from the EnvVar Kubernetes API.

Sometimes you may have a specific requirement to deploy containers on Kubernetes or OpenShift such as setting Resource Limits. SonataFlow Operator enables custom PodSpec definitions when deploying a SonataFlow instance by setting the .spec.podTemplate attribute. For example: Setting PodSpec Resources Limits example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: simple annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Simple example on k8s! sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 spec: podTemplate: (1) container: (2) resources: (3) limits: cpu: \"250m\" memory: \"128Mi\" flow: start: HelloWorld states: - name: HelloWorld type: inject data: message: Hello World end: true 1 The PodSpec template definition 2 The default workflow service container 3 Resources configuration The .spec.podTemplate attribute has the majority of fields defined in the default Kubernetes PodSpec API. The same Kubernetes API validation rules applies to these fields. The .spec.podTemplate.container is a special attribute that you won’t find in the default Kubernetes API. The reason is to avoid misconfiguration when users require to change the specific container where the workflow application is deployed. By default, the SonataFlow Operator deploys a SonataFlow instance in a regular Kubernetes Deployment object. Although it’s possible to change this behavior and deploy the workflow instance as a Knative Serving Service instead. To change the deployment to Knative, set the .spec.podTemplate.deploymentModel attribute to knative. For example: Setting PodSpec Resources Limits example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: simple annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Simple example on k8s! sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 sonataflow.org/version: preview spec: podTemplate: deploymentModel: knative (1) flow: start: HelloWorld states: - name: HelloWorld type: inject data: message: Hello World end: true 1 The deploymentModel attribute After changing the deployment model to knative, the SonataFlow instance will be deployed as a Knative Serving Service. It’s not possible to deploy a SonataFlow instance as a Knative Service in dev profile. In this profile, this attribute is ignored by the operator. Note that not every use case leverage a Knative deployment. Long-running workflow instances, for example, that calls services that might take too long to respond, might not be an ideal deployment model. Opt to use Knative deployments for workflows that won’t take too long to run. The exception are workflows that have callback states. In this case, you must configure persistence. This is required because once the workflow waits for the event to resume the execution, Knative will kill the pod. Since the workflow has persistence, it will resume the execution once it receives the callback event. Knative does not support initContainers by default. If your workflow requires it, you must first enable the extension in the Knative installation. See more information on the Knative documentation. Besides customizing the default container, you can add more containers, initContainers, or volumes to the pod. There are a few exceptions listed below: The containers array can’t have a container named workflow. If you set a container with this name, it will be ignored by the operator. Instead, use .spec.podTemplate.container to modify the workflow container. There are a few file system paths controlled by the operator within the container where it mounts important files. These volumes can’t be overrided, it will be ignored by the operatror. See the table below: Table 1. List of immutable volumes Volume Type Path Profile workflow-properties ConfigMap /deployments/config/application.properties, /deployments/config/application-prod.properties preview workflow-properties ConfigMap ${PROJECT_ROOT}/src/main/resources/application.properties, ${PROJECT_ROOT}/src/main/resources/application-dev.properties dev resources Projected ${PROJECT_ROOT}/src/main/resources/ dev In dev profile, all the SonataFlow .spec.resources objects are mounted in the resources projected volume listed in this table. Do not mount anything else in this path. Profiles are a way to change the runtime and deployment behavior of workflows. You can change the SonataFlow custom resource profile using annotations. For example: Example of a SonataFlow CR with a profile annotation apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: simple annotations: sonataflow.org/profile: preview (1) sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 spec: flow: start: HelloWorld states: - name: HelloWorld type: inject data: message: Hello World end: true 1 Preview profile defined in the sonataflow.org/profile annotation. This is the default profile. The SonataFlow Operator supports three different profiles: dev: The workflow will be deployed as a mutable container that will react upon any changes on the SonataFlow custom resource immediatelly. Ideal for scenarios where the flow definition is under active development and testing in the cluster context. See Developing Workflows with the Operator. preview: The operator will rely on an internal build system to build an immutable container based on the flow definition. Every change to the SonataFlow will kick a new build. Use this profile to evaluate the workflow behavior in the cluster or if you have a simple use case where you don’t need any complex build customizations. See Building and Deploying Workflows with the Operator gitops: Ideal for production use cases. This profile is automatically defined by the operator when the SonataFlow CR is deployed with a custom .spec.podTemplate.container.image. In this scenario, the user is responsible to build the workflow application and provide the image to the operator. There’s a correlation on the operator profile and the internal runtime workflow Quarkus application. See the table below. Table 2. Correlation of the operator and Quarkus profiles Operator Profile Quarkus Profile Description dev dev Suitable for testing only. The configuration file managed by the operator is application-dev.properties preview prod Suitable for quick evaluation and use of the internal builder system. The configuration file managed by the operator is application-prod.properties gitops prod Workflow image externally built by another system. The configuration file managed by the operator is application-prod.properties For more information about configuring workflows see Configuring Workflow Services. When setting the attribute .spec.podTemplate.container.image the operator understands that the workflow already have an image built and the user is responsible for the build and image maintainence. That means that the operator won’t try to upgrade this image in the future or do any reconciliation changes to it. In development profile, it’s expected that the image is based on the default docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-sonataflow-devmode:10.0.x. When building workflows, you can opt in to have the operator to handle the build process for you. However, in more complex scenarios it’s expected that the user owns and controls the build process. For this reason, when overriding the image the operator won’t build the workflow. The operator will try to deploy the workflow using the given image. In this scenario, the .spec.resources attribute is ignored since it’s only used during the build process in the production profile. In the roadmap you will find that we plan to consider the .spec.resources attribute when the image is specified in the default container. It’s advised that the SonataFlow .spec.flow definition and the workflow built within the image corresponds to the same workflow. If these definitions don’t match you may experience poor management and configuration. The SonataFlow Operator uses the .spec.flow attribute to configure the application, service discovery, and service binding with other deployments within the topology. It’s on the roadmap to add integrity check to the built images provided to the operator by customizing the default container.

Workflows in the development profile are not tailored for production environments. To build and deploy an immutable Workflow with the operator, see Building and Deploying Workflows with the Operator. SonataFlow Operator is under active development with features yet to be implemented. Please see SonataFlow Operator Known Issues, Limitations and Roadmap. Prerequisites You have set up your environment according to the minimal environment setup guide. You have the cluster instance up and running. See starting the cluster for local development guide. The development profile is the easiest way to start playing around with Workflows and the operator. To get started, you can use an editor of your choice to create a new SonataFlow Custom Resource YAML definition. For example: Example of a Kubernetes SonataFlow YAML definition apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: greeting annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Greeting example on k8s! sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 sonataflow.org/profile: dev (1) spec: flow: (2) start: ChooseOnLanguage functions: - name: greetFunction type: custom operation: sysout states: - name: ChooseOnLanguage type: switch dataConditions: - condition: \"${ .language == \\\"English\\\" }\" transition: GreetInEnglish - condition: \"${ .language == \\\"Spanish\\\" }\" transition: GreetInSpanish defaultCondition: GreetInEnglish - name: GreetInEnglish type: inject data: greeting: \"Hello from JSON Workflow, \" transition: GreetPerson - name: GreetInSpanish type: inject data: greeting: \"Saludos desde JSON Workflow, \" transition: GreetPerson - name: GreetPerson type: operation actions: - name: greetAction functionRef: refName: greetFunction arguments: message: \".greeting+.name\" end: true 1 The annotation sonataflow.org/profile: dev tells the operator to deploy the Workflow using the development profile. This means that the operator will build a running instance of the Workflow ready to receive changes during your development cycle. 2 In the flow attribute goes the Workflow definition as described by the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification. So if you already have a workflow definition, you can use it there. Alternatively, you can use the editors to create your workflow definition. Prerequisites You have a new SonataFlow Kubernetes Workflow definition in YAML file. You can use the Greeting example in introduction to development profile section. Having a Kubernetes Workflow definition in a YAML file , you can deploy it in your cluster with the following command: Deploying a new SonataFlow Custom Resource in Kubernetes kubectl apply -f -n Alternatively, you can try one of the examples available in the operator repository: Deploying the greeting Workflow example kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-serverless-operator/10.0.x/test/testdata/sonataflow.org_v1alpha08_sonataflow_devmode.yaml -n Replace with the Namespace you’re using to deploy your workflows You can follow the Workflow status to check if everything is fine with: Checking the Workflow status kubectl get workflow -n -w You should see the Workflow conditions evolving to READY in a few seconds: Example workflow deployment status NAME PROFILE VERSION ADDRESS READY REASON greeting dev 0.0.1 False WaitingForDeployment greeting dev 0.0.1 True The REASON field gives you a cue about the current Workflow status. You can make changes to the Workflow YAML using any Kubernetes editor. For example, you can use kubectl and the following command: kubectl edit workflow/greeting -n and changing the Workflow definition inside the Custom Resource Spec section. Alternatively, you can save the Custom Resource definition file and edit it with your desired editor and re-apply it. For example using VS Code, these are the commands needed: curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-serverless-operator/10.0.x/test/testdata/sonataflow.org_v1alpha08_sonataflow_devmode.yaml > workflow_devmode.yaml code workflow_devmode.yaml kubectl apply -f workflow_devmode.yaml -n The operator ensures that the latest Workflow definition is running and ready. This way, you can include the Workflow in your development scenario and start making requests to it. Prerequisites You have deployed a workflow to your cluster following the example in deploying new workflow section. In order to check that the SonataFlow Greeting workflow is up and running, you can try to perform a test HTTP call. First, you must get the service URL: Exposing the workflow Minikube Expose the workflow on minikube # Input minikube service greeting -n --url # Example output, use the URL as a base to acces the current workflow http://127.0.0.1:57053 # Your workflow is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:57053/greeting Kind Expose the workflow on kind # Find the service of your workflow kubectl get service -n # Example output NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE greetings ClusterIP 10.96.0.1 31852/TCP 21h # Now forward the port and keep the terminal window open kubectl port-forward service/greeting 31852:80 -n # Your workflow is accessible at localhost:31852/greetings When running on Minikube, the service is already exposed for you via NodePort. On OpenShift, a Route is automatically created in devmode. If you’re running on Kubernetes you can expose your service using an Ingress. You can now point your browser to the Swagger UI and start making requests with the REST interface. For example, using the above command execution you can access the Swagger UI via http://127.0.0.1:57053/q/swagger-ui/. At the Swagger UI, click on \"POST /greeting\", then on \"Try it out!\". Copy the following JSON message and hit execute: Operation Greeting result { \"name\": \"Jane Doe\" } Figure 1. The Swagger UI executing the POST /greeting operation You should see a result similar to this: Operation Greeting result { \"id\": \"984b5c6c-36ef-48ba-aa11-89fa54d25e98\", \"workflowdata\": { \"name\": \"Jane Doe\", \"greeting\": \"Hello from JSON Workflow, \" } } You can even make changes to your SonataFlow YAML file and see the results using the Swagger UI. In order to remove the SonataFlow Greeting, you can execute the following command: Removing the Workflow kubectl delete -f -n See the Referencing Additional Files in the Workflow guide for more complex scenarios where you may need to reference other resources in the workflow definition. If your scenario has strict policies for image usage, such as security or hardening constraints, you can replace the default image used by the operator. Alternatively, you might want to test a nightly build with a bug fix or a custom image containing your customizations. By default, the operator will use the image distributed upstream to run the workflows in the development profile. You can change this image by editing the SonataFlowPlatform custom resource in the namespace where you deployed your workflows: Patching the current SonataFlowPlatform with the new image # use `kubectl get sonataflowplatform` to get the SonataFlowPlatform name kubectl patch sonataflowplatform --patch 'spec:\\n devMode:\\n baseImage: ' -n From now on, every deployment in the development profile will use this image to run the workflow. The default image was created to run a Quarkus Java application in dev mode. You can replace this image with another one as long as it has the same concept. One way of doing this is using the default as the base image. See Building a Custom Development Image. As you make changes to your workflow during development, it’s likely that you will need to troubleshoot it when something goes wrong. To ensure the Workflow is running in a healthy state, the operator deploys its Pod with health check probes. If the changes you make to your Workflow cause the health checks to fail, the Pod executing the Workflow will stop responding. The following will help you discover the reason for any failure during development. Analyze the Workflow status with: Get the Workflow status conditions kubectl get workflow -o jsonpath={.status.conditions} | jq . It can give you a clue about what might be happening. See Understanding Workflow Services Status Conditions for more information. Fetch the logs and look for ERROR messages: Watch the workflow logs kubectl logs deployment/ -f -n If you decide to open an issue or ask for help in SonataFlow communication channels, this logging information is always useful for the person who will try to help you. The SonataFlow Operator is under active development. Sometimes a feature might not be available yet. Please see SonataFlow Operator Known Issues, Limitations and Roadmap for a comprehensive list of available features. If you identify that you are attempting to use a feature that is not available yet, you can file a new issue, so we can prioritize it. Alternatively, you can ask in SonataFlow communication channels. A wrong configuration (or lack of one) might prevent your Workflow from running correctly. The operator deploys a ConfigMap that holds the workflow properties for the Workflow. Get the properties ConfigMap kubectl get cm -props The ConfigMap name pattern is the Workflow name followed by -props. Make sure that the configuration is correct and you’re not missing any required properties for a given feature to work. You can make any changes to the configuration by simply editing the content of the ConfigMap. Once you have updated the configuration in the ConfigMap, the operator ensures that these properties are applied to the workflow. See Configuring Workflow Services for more information. The SonataFlow Operator validates the Workflow definition at the moment you create or edit the YAML file, preventing you from creating an invalid workflow. As the operator is under active development, errors during the validation might occur. In the case where validation has not prevented your error, you might have to make a few modifications to the Workflow definition to fix any problems. You can identify such problems by looking at the deployed Workflow logs as explained here. If you find an issue with a cause is not listed in this section, please let us know.

It is possible to deploy the Jobs Service manually, leveraging the Operator offers a more seamless integration by combining it with namespace configuration through the SonataFlowPlatform Custom Resource (CR). When the Operator oversees the lifecycle of the jobs service, it automatically injects necessary properties during creation into the SonataFlow workflows. This integration eliminates the need for including these properties within the SonataFlow workflow CR instance, simplifying workflow management. To enable the deployment of a Jobs Service instance, the SonataFlowPlatform CRD exposes a set of fields that allow the user to configure the running instance. The basic runtime is to deploy the Jobs Service with an ephemeral backend running in the same container as the Jobs Service runtime. --- apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: services: jobService: {} --- When executing this manifest, the operator will reconcile generating a pod hosting the Jobs Service: --- $>kubectl get pod -n sonataflow NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE sonataflow-platform-jobs-service-cdf85d969-sbwkj 1/1 Running 0 108s --- Keep in mind that this setup is not recommended for production environments, especially because the data does not persist when the pod restarts. For robust environments it is recommended to use an dedicated database service and configure Jobs Service to make use of it. Currently, the Jobs Service only supports PostgreSQL database. Configuring Jobs Service to communicate with an existing PostgreSQL instance is supported in two ways. In both cases it requires providing the persistence configuration, one by using the Jobs Service’s persistence field and the other one using the persistence field defined in the SonataFlowPlatform CR deployed in the same namespace. By default, the persistence specification defined in the SonataFlow workflow’s CR takes priority over the one in the SonataFlowPlatform persistence specification. Using the persistence configuration in the SonataFlowPlatform CR located in the same namespace requires to have the SonataFlow CR persistence field configured to have an empty {} value, signaling the Operator to derive the persistence from the active SonataFlowPlatform, when available. If no persistence is defined the operator will fallback to the ephemeral persistence previously described. --- apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: persistence: postgresql: secretRef: name: postgres-secrets userKey: POSTGRES_USER passwordKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD serviceRef: name: postgres port: 5432 databaseName: sonataflow --- And the SonataFlow CR looks like this: --- apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: callbackstatetimeouts annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Callback State Timeouts Example k8s sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 spec: persistence: {} ... --- When using the jdbcUrl field instead of serviceRef, the user is responsible for providing the correct JDBC URL connection value that does not contain a database schema because the operator will use verbatim the contents of this field as the JDBC connection in the Jobs Service pod, and if it provides a schema that has been used or formatted by a different client, the pod will fail to run. You can define the persistence configuration directly in the Jobs Service specification. The structure is the same as in the SonataFlowPlatform CR and also consist on the credentials to access the PostgreSQL instance, and the kubernetes service reference to generate the connectivity. --- apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: callbackstatetimeouts spec: persistence: postgresql: secretRef: name: postgres-secrets userKey: POSTGRES_USER passwordKey: POSTGRES_PASSWORD serviceRef: name: postgres port: 5432 databaseName: sonataflow databaseSchema: jobs-service --- In this example we’re using a PostgreSQL service located in the same namespace where the Jobs Service is deployed, pointing to the default PostgreSQL port of 5432 and referencing the database sonataflow and schema jobs-service.

Prerequisites You have installed the operator in the target cluster. You can find more information at the Install the SonataFlow Operator guide. After installing the operator, you can access the ConfigMap named sonataflow-operator-controllers-config in the namespace sonataflow-operator-system. This configuration file governs the operator’s behavior when creating new resources in the cluster. Existing resources won’t be changed after this configuration. See the section Configuration Changes Impact for more information. You can freely edit any of the options in the key controllers_cfg.yaml entry. The table bellow lists each possible entry. Table 1. Description of Global Configuration Configuration Key Default Value Description defaultPvcKanikoSize 1Gi The default size of Kaniko PVC when using the internal operator builder manager. healthFailureThresholdDevMode 50 How much time (in seconds) to wait for a devmode workflow to start. This information is used for the controller manager to create new devmode containers and setup the healthcheck probes. kanikoDefaultWarmerImageTag gcr.io/kaniko-project/warmer:v1.9.0 Default image used internally by the Operator Managed Kaniko builder to create the warmup pods. kanikoExecutorImageTag gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v1.9.0 Default image used internally by the Operator Managed Kaniko builder to create the executor pods. jobsServicePostgreSQLImageTag empty The Jobs Service image for PostgreSQL to use, if empty the operator will use the default Apache Community one based on the current operator’s version. jobsServiceEphemeralImageTag empty The Jobs Service image without persistence to use, if empty the operator will use the default Apache Community one based on the current operator’s version. dataIndexPostgreSQLImageTag empty The Data Index image for PostgreSQL to use, if empty the operator will use the default Apache Community one based on the current operator’s version. dataIndexEphemeralImageTag empty The Data Index image without persistence to use, if empty the operator will use the default Apache Community one based on the current operator’s version. sonataFlowBaseBuilderImageTag empty SonataFlow base builder image used in the internal Dockerfile to build workflow applications in preview profile. If empty the operator will use the default Apache Community one based on the current operator’s version. sonataFlowDevModeImageTag empty The image to use to deploy SonataFlow workflow images in devmode profile. If empty the operator will use the default Apache Community one based on the current operator’s version. builderConfigMapName sonataflow-operator-builder-config The default name of the builder configMap in the operator’s namespace. postgreSQLPersistenceExtensions next column Quarkus extensions required for workflows persistence. These extensions are used by the SonataFlow Operator builder in cases where the workflow being built has configured postgresql persistence. Default values: io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal:3.8.4 io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql:3.8.4 org.kie:kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc:10.0.0 kogitoEventsGrouping true When true, configures every workflow deployment with the gitops or preview profiles, to send accumulated workflow status change events to the Data Index. Reducing the number of produced events. Set to false to send individual events. kogitoEventsGroupingBinary true When true, the accumulated workflow status change events are sent in binary mode. Reducing the size of the produced events. Set to false to send plain json events. kogitoEventsGroupingCompress false When true, the accumulated workflow status change events, if sent in binary mode, are be gzipped at the cost of some performance. To edit this file, update the ConfigMap sonataflow-operator-controllers-config using your preferred tool such as kubectl. When updating the global configuration, the changes will be taken impact immediately for newly created resources only. For example, if you change sonataFlowDevModeImageTag property, given that you already have a workflow deployed in devmode, the operator won’t rollout a new one with the new image configuration. Only new deployments will be affected. As noted in Changing Base Builder section, you can directly change the base builder image in the Dockerfile used by the SonataFlow Operator. Additionally, you can also change the base builder image in the SonataFlowPlatform in the current namespace: Example of SonataFlowPlatform with a custom base builder apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: build: config: baseImage: dev.local/my-workflow-builder:1.0.0 And finally, you can also change this information directly in the global confinguration ConfigMap Example of ConfigMap global configuration with a custom base builder apiVersion: v1 data: controllers_cfg.yaml: | sonataFlowBaseBuilderImageTag: dev.local/my-workflow-builder:1.0.0 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: sonataflow-operator-controllers-config namespace: sonataflow-operator-system The order of precedence is: The SonataFlowPlatform in the current context The global configuration entry The FROM clause in the Dockerfile in the operator’s namespace sonataflow-operator-controllers-config ConfigMap In summary, the entry in SonataFlowPlatform will always override any other value.

The operator is in an early development stage (community only) and has been tested on OpenShift 4.13+ , Kubernetes 1.26+ , Minikube and Kind. Prerequisites A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster with admin privileges and kubectl installed. Alternatively, you can use Minikube or KIND in your local environment. See minimal environment setup and starting the cluster for local development guides. To install the operator on OpenShift refer to the \"Adding Operators to a cluster\" from the OpenShift’s documentation. When searching for the operator in the Filter by keyword field, use the word sonataflow. If you’re installing from the CLI, the operator’s catalog name is sonataflow-operator. To remove the operator on OpenShift refer to the \"Deleting Operators from a cluster\" from the OpenShift’s documentation. To install the operator on Kubernetes refer to the \"How to install an Operator from OperatorHub.io\" from the OperatorHub’s documentation. When searching for the operator in the Search OperatorHub field, use the word sonataflow. To remove the operator on Kubernetes follow the document \"Uninstall your operator\" from the OLM’s documentation. When searching for the subscription to remove, use the word my-sonataflow-operator. If you’re running on Kubernetes or OpenShift, it is highly recommended to install the operator from the OperatorHub or OpenShift Console instead since the installation is managed by OLM. Use this method only if you need a snapshot version or you’re running locally on Minikube or KIND. Prerequisites You have set up your environment according to the minimal environment setup guide. You have the cluster instance up and running. See starting the cluster for local development guide. To install the SonataFlow Operator, you can use the following command: Install SonataFlow Operator on Kubernetes kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/refs/heads/10.0.x/packages/sonataflow-operator/operator.yaml You can follow the deployment of the SonataFlow Operator: Watch the SonataFlow Operator pod kubectl get pod -n sonataflow-operator-system --watch A successful installation should have an output like this: Successful Installation Output NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE sonataflow-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2 0/2 ContainerCreating 0 6s sonataflow-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2 1/2 Running 0 7s sonataflow-operator-controller-manager-948547ffd-sr2j2 2/2 Running 0 20s You can also follow the operator’s log: Watch the SonataFlow Operator pod logs kubectl logs deployment/sonataflow-operator-controller-manager -n sonataflow-operator-system -f Once the operator is running, it will watch for instances of the SonataFlow Custom Resources (CR). Using CRs, you can configure your SonataFlow environment and define Workflows and builds to be handled by the operator. To uninstall the SonataFlow Operator, first, you must delete all the SonataFlow Custom Resources (CR) instances managed by it. Once the CRs are deleted, you can then delete all resources created during the operator installation. To delete every CR managed by the operator in your cluster, you can run these series of commands: Delete all SonataFlow CR instances kubectl delete --all workflow --all-namespaces kubectl delete --all sonataflowbuild --all-namespaces kubectl delete --all sonataflowplatform --all-namespaces Alternatively, if you created everything under the same Namespace, deleting the given namespace has the same outcome. To uninstall the correct version of the operator, first you must get the current version by running: Getting the operator version kubectl get deployment sonataflow-operator-controller-manager \\ -n sonataflow-operator-system \\ -o jsonpath=\"{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=='manager')].image}\" Expected output: docker.io/apache/incubator-kie-sonataflow-operator:10.0.x Uninstalling the operator kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-kie-tools/refs/heads/10.0.x/packages/sonataflow-operator/operator.yaml The URL should be the same as the one you used when installing the operator.

Most of the time, a workflow definition will require not only the flow definition, but also OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specification descriptors, schemas, subflows definitions, and etc. For example, when doing service orchestration using OpenAPI descriptors, you need to tell the workflow where to find these descriptors in your context. If these files are not in a remote location that can be accessed via the HTTP protocol, you must describe in the SonataFlow CR where to find them within the cluster. This is done via ConfigMaps. Prerequisites You have set up your environment according to the minimal environment setup guide. You have the cluster instance up and running. See starting the cluster for local development guide. You have permissions to create ConfigMaps in the target namespace of your cluster. (Optional) You have the files that you want to reference in your workflow definition ready. If you already have the files referenced in your workflow definition, you can create a ConfigMap in your target namespace with the contents of the file. In the example below, you need to use the contents of the specs/workflow-service-schema.json file and specs/workflow-service-openapi.json file to create the ConfigMap: Example of a workflow referencing additional files apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: service annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Hello Service! sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 sonataflow.org/profile: dev spec: flow: start: Service dataInputSchema: specs/workflow-service-schema.json (1) functions: - name: isWinner operation: specs/workflow-service-openapi.json#isWinner (2) type: rest states: - name: Service type: operation actions: - name: CallService functionRef: refName: isWinner end: true 1 The workflow defines an input schema 2 The workflow requires an OpenAPI specification file to make a REST invocation The Hello Service workflow in the example offers two options. You can either create two ConfigMaps, each for one file, to have a clear separation of concerns or group them into one. From the operator perspective, it won’t make any difference since both files will be available for the workflow application at runtime. To make it simple, you can create only one ConfigMap. Navigate into the directory where your resource files are available and create the config map using following command: Creating a ConfigMap from the current directory kubectl create configmap service-files --from-file=$(pwd) -n Replace with the namespace where you are going to deploy the workflow. The operator won’t access ConfigMaps in other namespaces. You should have a ConfigMap with two data entries similar to this one: Example of a ConfigMap containing the data for the worflow kind: ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: service-files data: workflow-service-schema.json: # data was removed to save space # workflow-service-openapi.json: # data was removed to save space # Now you can add reference to this ConfigMap into your SonataFlow CR: SonataFlow CR referencing a ConfigMap resource apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: service annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Hello Service! sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 sonataflow.org/profile: dev spec: resources: (1) configMaps: - configMap: name: service-files (2) workflowPath: specs (3) flow: start: Service dataInputSchema: specs/workflow-service-schema.json functions: - name: isWinner operation: specs/workflow-service-openapi.json#isWinner type: rest states: - name: Service type: operation actions: - name: CallService functionRef: refName: isWinner end: true 1 Introduced a new attribute .spec.resources where you can bind the ConfigMap to the SonataFlow CR 2 The name of the ConfigMap in the same namespace 3 The path where we want to reference these files Note that the workflowPath is specs. This is the path where you want to reference the files within the ConfigMap in the workflow definition. Always create your ConfigMaps before the SonataFlow since not having the files available during startup might break the deployment. Any files you have to map to the flow definition can be added to the SonataFlow CR using this procedure. The ConfigMap containing workflow files are not tied to a particular SonataFlow instance, just referenced by it. It means that the operator won’t edit or delete them if the SonataFlow CR is updated or deleted. You have total control of the ConfigMap instance. You can organize your ConfigMaps in a way that other workflows could reuse them. In other words, one ConfigMap can be mapped to many SonataFlow Custom Resources. For example, if you have many OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specification files that your workflows can access, you can group them by domain. This way you create a static Service Registry using ConfigMaps. Other developers within your company can reuse the same specification files when designing workflows. The same applies for data input and output schemas, subflows definitions, and so on.

Under the hood, it will discover the network endpoint (URL) to where to make the request. The service discovery occurs during the operator managed deployment of a workflow, or during the application startup if you are using a standalone Quarkus Workflow Project. In both cases, this feature scans all the Quarkus configurations in search of the URI pattern. Therefore, you must remember that if the application startup time matters, consider using a known static URL instead. Following is the custom URI pattern in Kubernetes service discovery: URI pattern in Kubernetes service discovery kubernetes:..//?= \\________/ \\____/ \\_______/ \\_____/ \\_________/ \\____________/ \\______________________________/ scheme kind version group namespace resourceName additional resource attributes \\____________________/ \\__________________________/ GVK Supported values: - port= - label-name1=label-value1 - label-name2=label-value2 The following scheme values are supported in the URI pattern: kubernetes openshift knative The following resources are supported for the Kubernetes GVK (Group, Version, and Kind): services.v1 services.v1.serving.knative.dev pods.v1 deployments.v1.apps deploymentconfigs.v1.apps.openshift.io statefulsets.v1.apps routes.v1.route.openshift.io ingresses.v1.networking.k8s.io When using knative, you can also use a simplified URI like: knative:/ The above URI looks directly for services.v1.serving.knative.dev resource. The namespace in the URI is optional, however, if namespace contains an empty value, the current namespace or context is used. Query parameters in URI Also known as query string. The query parameters are defined the similar way with URLs to assign value to specific attributes. The following query parameters help the engine to be more precise when querying for a given Kubernetes resource: Custom labels: The custom labels are used to filter services in case there are more than one service with the same label selector but exposing different ports. In this case, you can instruct the engine that if more than one service is found, then the engine must use the service containing the provided label. The label is defined with the following expression and in case of multiple labels, you can use ampersand (&): label-name1=label-value1&label-name2=label-value2 Example label definition in URI kubernetes:pods.v1//?tier=backend Using the previous URI example, if there are more than one service exposing the given pod, the tier=backend label is used to filter the service. If the label does not exist, the first found service is used. Custom port: The custom port is used to determine which port to use when multiple ports are configured in the target service. You can configure the port name to be queried using the following pattern: port= When you work with operator managed workflow deployments, there is no specific configuration required for the Kubernetes service discovery except by using the expected URI pattern. Based on the resource to be discovered, the Kubernetes service discovery follows specific paths as shown in the following figure: The Kubernetes service discovery is performed by the operator at workflow deployment time. At this point, the operator scans the workflow configuration parameters in the associated ConfigMap, and searches for the Kubernetes URI pattern. If the URI pattern is found, the operator parses the URI, queries the Kubernetes API searching for the given resource, and overrides the given parameter with the resolved value by adding an entry in the corresponding managed properties ConfigMap. For example, consider a workflow with the name mortgage-workflow that consumes a resource running on Kubernetes to execute financial operations implemented by the Knative Service financial-service. mortgage-workflow ConfigMap Properties kind: ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: mortgage-workflow-props namespace: example labels: app: mortgage-workflow sonataflow.org/workflow-app: mortgage-workflow data: application.properties: >+ # service discovery configuration to resolve the financial-service quarkus.rest-client.financial_service_yaml.url=${knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/financial-service} The service discovery URI must always be included in between ${} Finally, as part of the deployment procedure the operator will create the following mortgage-workflow-managed-props ConfigMap, that contains all the configurations that are managed by the operator, including the service discovery properties that were calculated for the configuration above. mortgage-workflow-managed-props ConfigMap Properties kind: ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: mortgage-workflow-managed-props namespace: example labels: app: mortgage-workflow sonataflow.org/workflow-app: mortgage-workflow data: application-dev.properties: > org.kie.kogito.addons.discovery.knative\\:services.v1.serving.knative.dev\\/financial-service = http://financial-service.example.svc.cluster.local quarkus.rest-client.financial_service_yaml.url = http://financial-service.example.svc.cluster.local quarkus.http.port = 8080 quarkus.http.host = 0.0.0.0 ... other operator calculated properties As you can see, the service discovery URI ${knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/financial-service} was resolved to the URL http://financial-service.example.svc.cluster.local. In the URI above, the namespace example was omitted intentionally on the assumption that the mortgage-workflow and the financial-service are deployed on the same example namespace. If this is not the case, you must add the financial-service’s namespace to that URI. For example ${knative:services.v1.serving.knative.dev/finance-department/financial-service} The mortgage-workflow-managed-props is generated by the operator, and any external change on that ConfigMap will be overwritten in the next reconciliation cycle.

In general, in a regular SonataFlow installation you must deploy both services to ensure a successful execution of your workflows. To get more information about each service please read the respective guides. Prerequisites The SonataFlow Operator installed. See Install the SonataFlow Operator guide. A PostgreSQL database service instance. Required if you are planning to use the PostgreSQL persistence configuration for a supporting service. When you deploy a supporting service in a given namespace, you can do it by using an enabled or disabled deployment. An enabled deployment, signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically intercept every workflow deployment with the preview or gitops profile, in this namespace, and automatically configure it to connect with that service. For example, if the Data Index is enabled, a workflow will be automatically configured to send workflow status change events to it. And, similar configurations are produced if the Job Service is enabled, to create a Job, every time a workflow requires a timeout. Additionally, the operator will configure the Job Service to send events to the Data Index Service, etc. As you can see, the operator can not only deploy a supporting service, but also, manage other configurations to ensure the successful execution of a workflow. Fortunately, all these configurations are managed automatically, and you must only provide the supporting services configuration in the SonataFlowPlatform CR. Scenarios where you only deploy one of the supporting services, or configure a disabled deployment, are intended for advanced use cases. In a regular installation, you must normally configure an enabled deployment of both services to ensure a successful execution of your workflows. To deploy the supporting services you must use the sub-fields dataIndex and jobService in the SonataFlowPlatform CR spec.services. That information signals the SonataFlow Operator to deploy each service when the SonataFlowPlatform CR is deployed. Each service configuration is considered independently, and you can combine these configurations with any other configuration present in the SonataFlowPlatform CR. The following SonataFlowPlatform CR fragment shows a scaffold configuration that you can use as reference: Supporting services configuration apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example namespace: example-namespace spec: services: dataIndex: (1) enabled: true (2) # Specific configurations for the Data Index Service # might be included here jobService: (3) enabled: true (4) # Specific configurations for the Job Service # might be included here 1 Data Index Service configuration field. 2 If true, produces an enabled Data Index Service deployment, see. Other cases produce a disabled deployment. The default is false. 3 Job Service configuration field. 4 If true, produces an enabled Job Service deployment, see. Other cases produce a disabled deployment. The default is false. The configuration above produces an ephemeral deployment of each service, see. The SonataFlowPlatform CR facilitates the deployment of the supporting services with namespace scope. It means that, all the automatically configured Supporting Services and Workflow communications, are restricted to the namespace of the given platform. This can be useful, in cases where you need separate supporting service instances for a set of workflows. For example, a given application can be deployed isolated with its workflows, and the supporting services. Additionally, using the SonataFlowClusterPlatform CR it’s possible to configure a cluster scoped deployment of the supporting services. The ephemeral persistence of a service is supported by an embedded PostgreSQL database dedicated to it. That database is re-created by the operator on every service restart. And thus, it’s only recommended for development and testing purposes. The ephemeral deployment of a service requires no additional configurations than the shown, here. The PostgreSQL persistence of a service is supported by a PostgreSQL server instance that you must previously install on the cluster. The administration of that instance is totally independent of the SonataFlow Operator scope, and to connect a supporting service with it, you must only configure the correct database connection parameters. The following SonataFlowPlatform CR fragment shows the configuration options that you must use: PostgreSQL persistence configuration apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example namespace: example-namespace spec: services: dataIndex: enabled: true persistence: postgresql: serviceRef: name: postgres-example (1) namespace: postgres-example-namespace (2) databaseName: example-database (3) databaseSchema: data-index-schema (4) port: 1234 (5) secretRef: name: postgres-secrets-example (6) userKey: POSTGRESQL_USER (7) passwordKey: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD (8) jobService: enabled: true persistence: postgresql: # Specific database configuration for the Job Service # might be included here. 1 Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server. 2 (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform’s local namespace. 3 Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the supporting service data. 4 (Optional) Name of the PostgreSQL database schema to store the supporting service data. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform’s name, suffixed with -data-index-service or -jobs-service. For example, sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service. 5 (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432. 6 Name of the Kubernetes Secret containing the username and password to connect with the database. 7 Name of the Kubernetes Secret key containing the username to connect with the database. 8 Name of the Kubernetes Secret key containing the password to connect with the database. The persistence of each service can be configured independently by using the respective persistence field. To create the secrets for the example above you can use a command like this: Create secret example kubectl create secret generic postgres-secrets-example --from-literal=POSTGRESQL_USER= --from-literal=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD= -n postgres-example-namespace To configure a common PostgreSQL service instance for all the supporting services you must read, Configuring the persistence using the SonataFlowPlatform CR. In that case, the SonataFlow Operator will automatically connect any of the supporting services with that common server configured in the field spec.persistence. And, similarly to the workflow’s persistence, the following precedence rules apply: If a supporting service has a configured persistence, for example, the field services.dataIndex.persistence is configured. That configuration will apply. If a supporting service has no configured persistence, for example, the field services.dataIndex.persistence is not set at all, the persistence configuration will be taken from the current platform. When you use the common PostgreSQL configuration, the database schema for each supporting service is automatically configured as the SonataFlowPlatform’s name, suffixed with -data-index-service or -jobs-service respectively. For example, sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service. In general, the following events are produced in a SonataFlow installation: Workflow outgoing and incoming business events. SonataFlow system events sent from the workflow to the Data Index and Job Service respectively. SonataFlow system events sent from the Jobs Service to the Data Index Service. The SonataFlow Operator is designed to use the Knative Eventing system to resolve all the event communication between these services. In a regular SonataFlow installation, the preferred method is to use the Platform scoped Eventing System Configuration, while the Service scoped Eventing System configuration is reserved only for advanced use cases. To configure a platform-scoped eventing system, you must use the field spec.eventing.broker.ref in the SonataFlowPlatform CR to refer to a Knative Eventing Broker. This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link the supporting services to produce and consume the events by using that Broker. Additionally, workflows deployed in that namespace, with the preview or gitops profile, that don’t provide a custom eventing system configuration, will be linked to that Broker. For more information about configuring the workflow eventing system, see. The following SonataFlowPlatform CR fragment shows an example of such configuration: Platform scoped eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example namespace: example-namespace spec: eventing: broker: ref: name: example-broker (1) namespace: example-broker-namespace (2) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker 1 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker. 2 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform namespace. We recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlowPlatform. In production environments, you must use a production-ready broker, like the Knative Kafka Broker. A service scoped eventing system configuration provides the ability to do a fine-grained configuration of the Eventing system for the Data Index or the Jobs Service. In a regular SonataFlow installation, the preferred method is to use a Platform-scoped Eventing System Configuration, while the service-scoped configuration is reserved only for advanced use cases. To configure a service-scoped eventing system for the Data Index, you must use the field spec.services.dataIndex.source.ref in the SonataFlowPlatform CR to refer to a specific Knative Eventing Broker. This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link the Data Index to consume the SonataFlow system events from that Broker. Data Index service scoped eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example spec: services: dataIndex: source: ref: name: data-index-source-example-broker (1) namespace: data-index-source-example-broker-namespace (2) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker 1 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker to consume events from. 2 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform namespace. In general, we recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlowPlatform. In production environments, you must use a production-ready broker, like the Knative Kafka Broker. To configure a service-scoped eventing system for the Jobs Service, you must use the fields spec.services.jobService.source.ref and spec.services.jobService.sink.ref in the SonataFlowPlatform CR. This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link the Jobs Service to consume and produce the SonataFlow system events from that configuration respectively. Jobs Service scoped eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example spec: services: jobService: source: ref: name: jobs-service-source-example-broker (1) namespace: jobs-service-source-example-broker-namespace (2) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker sink: ref: name: jobs-service-sink-example-broker (3) namespace: jobs-service-sink-example-broker-namespace (4) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker 1 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker to consume events from. 2 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform namespace. In general, we recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlowPlatform. 3 Name of the Knative Eventing Broker to produce events on. 4 Optional: Defines the namespace of the Knative Eventing Broker. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform namespace. In general, we recommend creating the Knative Eventing Broker in the same namespace as the SonataFlowPlatform. In production environments, you must use production-ready brokers, like the Knative Kafka Broker. When you use a Cluster Scoped Supporting Services deployment, the supporting services are automatically linked to the Broker configured in the SonataFlowPlatform CR referred to by the SonataFlowClusterPlatform CR. To configure the eventing system for a supporting service, the SonataFlow Operator use the following precedence rules: If the supporting service has a configured eventing system, by using any of the Data Index Eventing system configuration or Jobs Service Eventing system configuration respectively, that configuration applies. If the SonataFlowPlatform CR enclosing the supporting service, is configured with a Platform-scoped Eventing system configuration, that configuration applies. If the current cluster, is configured with a Cluster-scoped Eventing system configuration, that configuration apply. If none of the previous configurations exists, the supporting service is configured to produce direct HTTP calls to deliver events. The linking of the supporting services with the Eventing System is produced by using Knative Eventing SinkBindings and Triggers. These objects are automatically created by the SonataFlow Operator, and facilitate the events production and consumption from the supporting services. The following example shows the Knative Native eventing objects created for the SonataFlowPlatform CR: SonataFlowPlatform eventing system configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example namespace: example-namespace spec: eventing: broker: ref: name: example-broker (1) apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker services: dataIndex: (2) enabled: true jobService: (3) enabled: true 1 Platform Broker configuration used by the Data Index, Jobs Service, and the workflows if not overridden. 2 Data Index ephemeral deployment. 3 Jobs Service ephemeral deployment.

Defaults to 1. In the case of the jobService this value is always overridden to 1 by the operator, since that service is a singleton service. 2 Holds the particular configurations for the container that will execute the given supporting service. 3 Standard Kubernetes env configuration. This can be useful in cases where you need to fine tune any of the supporting services properties. 4 Standard Kubernetes image configuration. This can be useful in cases where you need to use an updated image for any of the supporting services. 5 Standard Kubernetes initContainers for the Pod that executes the supporting service. The podTemplate field of any supporting service has the majority of fields defined in the default Kubernetes PodSpec API. The same Kubernetes API validation rules apply to these fields. The SonataFlowClusterPlatform CR is optionally used to specify a cluster-wide set of supporting services for workflow consumption. This is done by referencing an existing, namespaced SonataFlowPlatform CR. Following is a basic configuration that allows workflows, deployed in any namespace, to leverage supporting services deployed in the chosen example-namespace namespace. Example of a SonataFlowClusterPlatform CR apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowClusterPlatform metadata: name: cluster-platform spec: platformRef: name: sonataflow-platform-example (1) namespace: example-namespace (2) 1 Name of the already installed SonatataFlowPlatform CR that configures the supporting services. 2 Namespace of the already installed SontataFlowPlatform CR that configures the supporting services. These cluster-wide services can be overridden in any namespace, by configuring that namespace’s SonataFlowPlatform.spec.services. The SonataFlow Operator extends its scope to manage the lifecycle of the Data Index and Job Service instances, thus removing the burden on the users and allowing them to focus on the implementation of the workflows. It takes care also of managing all the configurations to facilitate communication between the workflows and the supporting services. Additionally, it can manage different persistence options for each service, and advanced configurations.

Kubernetes’s pods are stateless by definition. In some scenarios, this can be a challenge for workloads that require maintaining the status of the application regardless of the pod’s lifecycle. In the case of SonataFlow, by default, the context of the workflow is lost when the pod restarts. If your workflow requires recovery from such scenarios, you must provide additional configuration to enable the Workflow Runtime Persistence. That configuration must be provided by using the SonataFlowPlatform CR or the SonataFlow CR, and has different scopes depending on each case. The SonataFlowPlatform CR facilitates the configuration of the persistence with namespace scope. It means that it will be automatically applied to all the workflows deployed in that namespace. This can be useful to reduce the amount resources to configure, for example, in cases where the workflows deployed in that namespace belongs to the same application, etc. That decision is left to each particular use case, however, it’s important to know, that this configuration can be overridden by any workflow in that namespace by using the SonataFlow CR. Finally, the SonataFlow Operator can also use this configuration to set the supporting service’s persistence. Persistence configurations are applied at workflow deployment time, and potential changes in the SonataFlowPlatform will not impact already deployed workflows. To configure the persistence you must use the persistence field in the SonataFlowPlatform CR spec: SonataFlowPlatform CR persistence configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform-example namespace: example-namespace spec: persistence: postgresql: serviceRef: name: postgres-example (1) namespace: postgres-example-namespace (2) databaseName: example-database (3) port: 1234 (4) secretRef: name: postgres-secrets-example (5) userKey: POSTGRESQL_USER (6) passwordKey: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD (7) 1 Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server. 2 (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the SonataFlowPlatform’s local namespace. 3 Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the workflow’s data. 4 (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432. 5 Name of the Kubernetes Secret containing the username and password to connect with the database. 6 Name of the Kubernetes Secret key containing the username to connect with the database. 7 Name of the Kubernetes Secret key containing the password to connect with the database. This configuration signals the operator that every workflow deployed in the current SonataFlowPlatform’s namespace must be properly configured to connect with that PostgreSQL database server. And the operator will add the relevant JDBC connection parameters in the form of environment variables to the workflow container. Additionally, for SonataFlow CR deployments that use the preview profile, it will configure the SonataFlow build system to include specific Quarkus extensions required for persistence. Currently, PostgreSQL is the only supported persistence. Below you can see an example of the configurations produced for a workflow with the name example-workflow, that was deployed using the previous SonataFlowPlatform. For simplicity, only the env configurations related to the persistence has been included. These operator managed configurations are immutable. Generated persistence env configurations in the workflow container env: - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: postgres-secrets-example key: POSTGRESQL_USER - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: postgres-secrets-example key: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_DB_KIND value: postgresql - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL value: >- jdbc:postgresql://postgres-example.postgres-example-namespace:1234/sonataflow?currentSchema=example-workflow - name: KOGITO_PERSISTENCE_TYPE value: jdbc When you use the SonataFlowPlatform persistence, every workflow is configured to use a PostgreSQL schema name equal to the workflow name. To learn how to initialize the database schema see: Database schema initialization. The SonataFlow CR facilitates the configuration of the persistence with workflow scope, and you can use it independently if the SonataFlowPlatform persistence was already configured in the current namespace, see: Persistence configuration precedence rules. To configure the persistence, you must use the persistence field in the SonataFlow CR spec: SonataFlow CR persistence configuration example apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: example-workflow annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Example Workflow sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 spec: persistence: postgresql: serviceRef: name: postgres-example (1) namespace: postgres-example-namespace (2) databaseName: example-database (3) databaseSchema: example-schema (4) port: 1234 (5) secretRef: name: postgres-secrets-example (6) userKey: POSTGRESQL_USER (7) passwordKey: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD (8) flow: ... 1 Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server. 2 (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the workflow’s local namespace. 3 Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the workflow’s data. 4 (Optional) Name of the database schema to store workflow’s data. Defaults to the workflow’s name. 5 (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432. 6 Name of the Kubernetes Secret containing the username and password to connect with the database. 7 Name of the Kubernetes Secret key containing the username to connect with the database. 8 Name of the Kubernetes Secret key containing the password to connect with the database. This configuration signals the operator that the current workflow must be properly configured to connect with that PostgreSQL database server when deployed. Similar to the SonataFlowPlatform persistence, the operator will add the relevant JDBC connection parameters in the form of environment variables to the workflow container. Additionally, for SonataFlow CR deployments that use the preview profile, it can configure the SonataFlow build system to include specific Quarkus extensions required for persistence. Currently, PostgreSQL is the only supported persistence. To learn how to initialize the database schema see: Database schema initialization. SonataFlow CR persistence can be used with or without the SonataFlowPlatform CR persistence. And, if the current namespace has an already configured SonataFlowPlatform CR persistence, the following rules apply: If the SonataFlow CR has a configured persistence, that configuration will apply. If the SonataFlow CR has no configured persistence, i.e., the field spec.persistence is not present at all, the persistence configuration will be taken from the current platform. If you don’t want the current workflow to use persistence, you must use the following configuration in the SonataFlow CR: spec.persistence : {} to ignore the SonataFlowPlatform persistence configuration. All the configurations shown for the SonataFlowPlatform CR and SonataFlow CR, apply exactly the same for both the preview and the gitops profiles. However, you must not use them in the dev profile, since this profile will simply ignore them. Finally, the only distinction between preview and gitops profiles is that, when you use the gitops profile, the following Quarkus extensions must be added when you build your workflow image. Since that build is accomplished outside the operator scope. groupId artifactId version io.quarkus quarkus-agroal 3.8.4 io.quarkus quarkus-jdbc-postgresql 3.8.4 org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc 10.0.0 If you generate your images by using the kogito-swf-builder, you can do it by passing it the following build argument: QUARKUS_EXTENSIONS=io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal:3.8.4,io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql:3.8.4,org.kie:kie-addons-quarkus-persistence-jdbc:10.0.0 When you use the SonataFlow PostgreSQL persistence, you can either opt to use Flyway to produce the database initialization, or manually upgrade your database via DDL scripts. To enable Flyway you must use any of the following configuration procedures: The Flyway schema initialization is disabled by default. Add the following property to your workflow ConfigMap. Example of enabling Flyway by using the workflow ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: labels: app: example-workflow name: example-workflow-props data: application.properties: | quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start = true Add the following env var in the spec.podTemplate.container of the SonataFlow CR. Example of enabling Flyway by using the workflow container env vars apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlow metadata: name: example-workflow annotations: sonataflow.org/description: Example Workflow sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1 spec: podTemplate: container: env: - name: QUARKUS_FLYWAY_MIGRATE_AT_START value: 'true' flow: ... To apply a common Flyway configuration to all the workflows in a given namespace, you can use the spec.properties.flow of the SonataFlowPlatform in that namespace. Example of enabling Flyway by using the SonataFlowPlatform properties. apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08 kind: SonataFlowPlatform metadata: name: sonataflow-platform spec: properties: flow: - name: quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start value: true The configuration above takes effect at workflow deployment time, so you must be sure that the property is configured before you deploy your workflows. To initialize the database schema manually, you must be sure that the following application property quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start is not configured, or is set to false, and follow this procedure. Remember that: By default, every workflow is configured use a schema name equal to the workflow name, and thus, that manual initialization must be applied for every workflow. When you use the SonataFlow CR persistence configuration it is possible to use the schema name of your choice. By using the SonataFlowPlatform CR you can enable the persistence for all the workflows that you deploy in that namespace. And, by using the SonataFlow CR you can enable the persistence of a particular workflow. If both methods are present in the current namespace, the SonataFlow CR configuration has precedence over the SonataFlowpPlatform configuration.

The initial model of the serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus example application is empty. Once the workflow is started, it publishes a CloudEvent of the resume type and waits for a CloudEvent, which contains the type wait. A listener consumes the CloudEvent with the resume type and simulates the behavior of an external service. Consequently, on the external service side, when the actions associated with the resume type CloudEvent are completed, the listener publishes a wait type CloudEvent. Once the wait type CloudEvent is received, the workflow moves to the next state and ends successfully. To use the Callback state in a workflow, first CloudEvent types such as resume and wait are declared that the workflow uses. Following is an example of CloudEvents declaration in a workflow definition: Example of CloudEvents declaration in a workflow definition \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"resumeEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"resume\" }, { \"name\": \"waitEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"wait\" } ] After that, a Callback state is declared. The Callback state publishes a resume type CloudEvent and waits for a CloudEvent with wait type. The published CloudEvent contains a move data field, and the CloudEvent that is received is expected to contain a result data field. According to the eventDataFilter, the result data field is added to the workflow model as a move field. Following is an example of declaring a Callback state that handles the wait type CloudEvent: Example of a Callback State declaration handling the wait CloudEvent { \"name\": \"waitForEvent\", \"type\": \"callback\", \"action\": { \"name\": \"publishAction\", \"eventRef\": { \"triggerEventRef\": \"resumeEvent\", \"data\": \"{move: \\\"This is the initial data in the model\\\"}\" } }, \"eventRef\": \"waitEvent\", \"eventDataFilter\": { \"data\": \".result\", \"toStateData\": \".move\" }, \"transition\": \"finish\" } An event listener consumes the resume type CloudEvent and publishes a new wait type CloudEvent. Following is an example of a Java method that publishes the wait type CloudEvent: Example of a Java method that publishes the wait CloudEvent private String generateCloudEvent(String id, String input) { Map eventBody = new HashMap<>(); eventBody.put(\"result\", input + \" and has been modified by the event publisher\"); eventBody.put(\"dummyEventVariable\", \"This will be discarded by the process\"); try { return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(CloudEventBuilder.v1() .withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString()) .withSource(URI.create(\"\")) .withType(\"wait\") .withTime(OffsetDateTime.now()) .withExtension(CloudEventExtensionConstants.PROCESS_REFERENCE_ID, id) .withData(objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(eventBody)) .build()); } catch (JsonProcessingException e) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(e); } } After that, the workflow application consumes the event published by the listener and sets the result field. The consumed CloudEvent contains an attribute named kogitoprocrefid, which holds the workflow instance ID of the workflow. The kogitoprocrefid attribute is crucial because when the correlation is not used, then this attribute is the only way for the Callback state to identify that the related CloudEvent needs to be used to resume the workflow. For more information about correlation, see Event correlation in SonataFlow. Note that each workflow is identified by a unique instance ID, which is automatically included in any published CloudEvent, as kogitoprocinstanceid CloudEvent extension. The following example shows that the event listener takes the workflow instance ID of a workflow from a CloudEvent attribute named kogitoprocinstanceid, which is associated with the CloudEvent that is consumed. Example of a Java method that consumes the resume CloudEvent @Incoming(\"in-resume\") @Outgoing(\"out-wait\") @Acknowledgment(Strategy.POST_PROCESSING) public String onEvent(Message message) { Optional ce = CloudEventUtils.decode(message.getPayload()); JsonCloudEventData cloudEventData = (JsonCloudEventData) ce.get().getData(); return generateCloudEvent(ce.get().getExtension(CloudEventExtensionConstants.PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID).toString(), cloudEventData.getNode().get(\"move\").asText()); } Apache Kafka configuration in serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus The serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus example application requires an external broker to manage the associated CloudEvents. The default setup in the serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus example application uses Apache Kafka. However, you can also use Knative Eventing. Apache Kafka uses topics to publish or consume messages. In the serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus example application, two topics are used, matching the name of the CloudEvent types that are defined in the workflow, such as resume and wait. The resume and wait CloudEvent types are configured in the application.properties file.

This feature is enabled by Quarkus Dev Services, and leverages Testcontainers to start an image of the Data Index service. The SonataFlow Process Quarkus extension sets up your Quarkus application to automatically replicate any SonataFlow messaging events related to workflow instances or jobs into the provisioned Data Index instance. Once the service is up and running, you can query the GraphQL interface directly using http://localhost:8180/graphql or using the Quarkus Dev UI console http://localhost:8080/q/dev. The Data Index GraphQL endpoint can query for ProcessInstances and Jobs. For more information about operations and attributes to query, see GraphQL endpoint provided by Data Index section. You can share the same Data Index instance across multiple SonataFlow services during development. Sharing Data Index instances is enabled by default, therefore, only one Data Index instance is started. This behavior can be adjusted to start multiple instances using the quarkus.kogito.devservices.shared property. The Quarkus Dev Service also allows further configuration options including: To disable Data Index Dev Service, use the quarkus.kogito.devservices.enabled=false property. To change the port where the Data Index Dev Service runs, use the quarkus.kogito.devservices.port=8180 property. To adjust the provisioned image, use quarkus.kogito.devservices.imageName=quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-data-index-ephemeral property.

You simply need to add the Data Index extension to the workflow and the related data will be collected and stored in the database, enabling the GraphQL endpoint to execute queries and perform management operations over the workflow instances. The example described in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-timeouts_showcase_embedded example application. The Data Index service has been designed to store and manage data from different workflow instances. Communication with the service is through events that contain the workflows related data and the service is responsible for storing them and exposing a GraphQL endpoint to allow queries and maintenance operations on the different workflow instances. In specific use cases, to avoid deploying the service separately, it could be useful to have the indexing functionality and the query capabilities embedded in the same application. For this purpose, the Quarkus Data Index extension can be added to any workflow application and incorporates the full Data Index functionality into the same application without needing an external Data Index service. These extensions are distributed as addons ready to work with different types of persistence: kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-inmemory (inmemory PostgreSQL) kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql With the same purpose, the Quarkus Data Index persistence extension can be added to any workflow application and incorporates only the Data Index indexation and data persistence functionality into the same application without needing an external Data Index service to do that. These extensions are distributed as addons ready to work with different types of persistence: kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence-postgresql In this case to interact with that data and related runtimes using GraphQL you will need an external Data Index service that makes that endpoint available. The Data Index extensions are provided as addons for each kind of supported persistence relying on the Quarkus extensions mechanism. Once one of these kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index or kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence addons is added to a workflow, it incorporates the functionality to index and store the workflow data. In case of the kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index also incorporates the GraphQL endpoint to perform queries and management operations. In the same way as the Data Index service, there is a specific addon for each type of persistence you want to work with. Currently, you can find Data Index addons for: PostgreSQL. The Data Index addon distribution added to the workflow must match the workflow’s persistence type regarding the indexed data, which can be stored in the same database. The addon will share the data source used by the workflow where it is added, and it will create separate tables for that purpose. When any of the kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index or kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-persistence addons is added: The communication with the workflow is direct, the workflow data is not transmitted or consumed through events, they are stored directly in the configured database. There is no need to configure the events connection for this purpose. Only when any of the kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index addons is added: A new GraphQL endpoint is added to perform queries and management operations when kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index is added You can add the Data Index quarkus extension as an addon: Prerequisites Your workflow is running and has persistence enabled. Data Index is using the same datasource to store indexed data For more information about creating a workflow, see Creating your first workflow. You also can find more details about enabling persistence in Running a workflow using PostgreSQL Procedure Add the kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index extension to your Quarkus Workflow Project using any of the following alternatives: Manually to the POM.xml Apache Maven Quarkus CLI org.kie kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=\"kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql\" quarkus extension add kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-postgresql Configure the Data Index Addon properties.

When adding the addon to the workflow, you need to disable it by setting quarkus.kogito.devservices.enabled to false in the application.properties file. 2 The addon allows to expose a simple UI to interact with the GraphQL endpoint, it only will be available when this property is set to true, and it will be placed in '/graphql-ui/` For more information, see application.properties file of serverless-timeouts_showcase_embedded example application.

You can use the following command to verify the current namespace: Verify the current namespace kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{..namespace}' Deploy your SonataFlow application on Kubernetes. The next step is to deploy your workflow application and execute it. You can read the further sections on the different procedures to deploy your SonataFlow application. You can use the native image due to the faster startup. In the following procedures, you can find different approaches to deploy your workflow application, such as: Using kubectl command-line tool Using Quarkus CLI For this tutorial, we use the default-domain provided by Knative that configures Knative Serving to use the Magic DNS for naming resolution, for more details please check the Knative documentation. You can also use kubectl command-line interface and plain Kubernetes objects to deploy your workflow application. And, instead of creating knative yaml|json descriptors, you can leverage the Quarkus Kubernetes extension and Kogito Knative add-on to generate the descriptors. Prerequisites Kogito Workflow application ready to use. Kubernetes CLI command-line tool is installed. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI.

For more information see Serverless Workflow plug-in for Knative CLI. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information, see Building Quarkus Apps with Quarkus command line interface (CLI). To deploy your workflow application on Minikube, you need to install Knative on Minikube. However, first you need to ensure that Minikube is installed correctly. You can check the Minikube installation by entering the following commands in a command terminal: Verify Minikube version minikube version Verify Knative CLI version kn version Verify kubectl CLI version kubectl version If kubectl is not installed, then Minikube handles it when you execute the following command: kubectl is available using Minikube alias kubectl=\"minikube kubectl --\" Once you verify the Minikube and Knative CLI installation, you can install Knative on Minikube. Prerequisites Minikube is installed. Knative CLI is installed. For more information, see Install the Knative CLI. Procedure Open a command terminal and install Knative on Minikube. Configure Knative on Minikube. Knative CLI offers quickstart plug-in, which provides the required configurations. For information about installing the quickstart plug-in, see Install Knative using quickstart. After configuring the plug-in, execute the following command to configure a Minikube profile: Configure a Minikube profile kn quickstart minikube The previous command configures a Minikube profile called knative. After creating a Minikube profile, all Minikube commands use the created profile. To list the available Minikube profiles, enter the following command: List the available Minikube profiles minikube profile list Enter the following command to open the Minikube web console on the knative profile: Open Minikube web console minikube dashboard --profile knative The previous command opens the Kubernetes Management console in your browser. If the console is not opened, you can go to the URL that is returned. To follow the manual process of installing Knative on Minikube, see Knative tutorial on Minikube. Once you install Knative on Minikube, you can initiate the process of deploying your workflow application on Minikube. Prerequisites Minikube is installed. Knative is ready. For more information, see Installing Knative on Minikube. Knative CLI is installed. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information, see Building Quarkus Apps with Quarkus command line interface (CLI). Your SonataFlow application is ready to use. Procedure In a command terminal, enter the following command to configure Docker to use the in-cluster Docker daemon: Configure Docker to use in-cluster Docker Daemon eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env --profile knative) Build your application to store it in the Minikube registry. If your workflow application container image is built before configuring Docker to use the in-cluster Docker daemon, then you might need to build the image again so that the image is available in the Minikube registry. If you are building native container images, ensure that you use the following system property to use Minikube Docker Daemon: System property to build container images -Dquarkus.native.remote-container-build=true You might be required to tag the container images using one of the following registry: ko.local dev.local For more information, see How to use locally built docker image. In that case, use the -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=some_of_the_values_above property to enable Knative fetch the container images from Minikube Docker Daemon. If you do not use the values, you might need to set the imagePullPolicy to Never or IfNotPresent, otherwise, Minikube pulls the images from a remote registry. This behavior can be avoided by tagging the image using previously listed domains. In a separate command terminal window, start the Minikube tunnel using the Knative profile to prepare the environment: Start Minikube tunnel using Knative profile minikube tunnel --profile knative The previous command starts in a loop. Therefore, this command must be running throughout the process mentioned in this document. On Mac and Windows, you might be required to provide the user password.

Prerequisites Your SonataFlow application is ready to use. OpenShift CLI is installed. Knative CLI is installed. Knative CLI workflow plugin is installed. Podman If you are using Docker, you might need to update the commands accordingly. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed. For the following steps we will be using the OpenShift Local. However, the steps described here can be used on any OpenShift 4.x version that has support for OpenShift Serverless. If you already have an OpenShift cluster available you can skip this section. Instructions to install OpenShift Local can be found here. Once you have OpenShift Local running, proceed to the next topic. If you are running OpenShift Local on Mac with M1 processors, you might not find the OpenShift Serverless Operator available. Before proceeding further, make sure that you have access to the OpenShift cluster, the OpenShift Serverless operator is properly installed and the Knative Serving is ready for use. For more information on each topic, please refer the following guides: Installing OpenShift Serverless Operator. Installing Knative Serving. Installing Knative Eventing. Knative Eventing is not required for this guide, however it is important to mention how to install it, if required by your SonataFlow application. If you get error messages related to Istio, this article might be helpful. Once Knative Serving is ready, you can initiate the process of deploying your SonataFlow application on OpenShift. Prerequisites OpenShift with Red Hat OpenShift Serverless is ready. Knative is ready. For more information, see Knative Serving. Knative CLI is installed. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information, see Building Quarkus Apps with Quarkus command line interface (CLI). Your SonataFlow application is ready to use. After checking the prerequisites, prepare the project that will be used to deploy your application: Procedure Create project oc new-project kogito-serverless Set the Kubernetes context to the newly created namespace using the following command: Set OpenShift current project oc project kogito-serverless You can use the native image for a faster startup. OpenShift comes with a registry where you can push your images built locally to be deployed. First, let’s check if the Registry is already exposed, to do that, check if the route is exposed: Check whether the OpenShift registry is exposed oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}' If no information or an error is returned, it does mean that the registry is not exposed. To expose the registry follow these steps. Now that we have the OpenShift registry exposed, let’s store into the OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL environment variable, so we can use it easily in the next steps: Retrieve the OpenShift registry OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}') The OpenShift’s registry requires you to be logged in to be allowed to push Container Images. If you are already logged in the cluster you can use your token to authenticate to the OpenShift’s registry: Log in to the OpenShift’s registry podman login -u -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL If everything is working, you should get the Login Succeeded! message. Pushing SonataFlow Application To OpenShift’s registry First step, get the Container Image tag built previously: podman images With the Container Image, use the following command to tag the application image with the OpenShift’s registry and the namespace being used: podman tag $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL/kogito-serverless/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 Then, push: podman push $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL/kogito-serverless/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 The kogito-serverless is the current project/namespace created earlier to deploy your SonataFlow application. The next step is to deploy your workflow application and execute it. You can read further the next sections which explain different approaches to deploy your SonataFlow application: In the next steps you will notice the value image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000 being used. It is the internal OpenShift’s registry address where the images of the deployments will be pulled from. Note that, the Container Image pushed in the previous step will be queried as image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kogito-serverless/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 Using Knative CLI (kn) Using OpenShift command-line tool Using Quarkus CLI Once you have pushed your workflow application into the OpenShift’s registry, you can use the command-line tools, such as Knative CLI or OpenShift CLI to initiate the deployment process. Prerequisites Workflow application is installed. Knative CLI is installed. For more information, see Install the Knative CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, execute the following command to deploy your workflow application using Knative CLI: Example of deploying workflow application using Knative CLI kn service create hello-workflow \\ --image=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/kogito-serverless/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 \\ --pull-policy=IfNotPresent \\ --port 8080 Example output Creating service 'hello-workflow' in namespace 'serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus': 0.066s The Route is still working to reflect the latest desired specification. 0.099s ... 0.322s Configuration \"hello-workflow\" is waiting for a Revision to become ready. 4.885s ... 5.061s Ingress has not yet been reconciled. 5.322s Waiting for load balancer to be ready 5.460s Ready to serve.

And, instead of creating knative yaml|json descriptors, you can leverage the Quarkus Kubernetes extension and Kogito Knative add-on to generate the descriptors. Prerequisites Kogito Workflow application ready to use. OpenShift CLI command-line tool is installed. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI.

Knative Eventing abstracts the events consumption through event source and sink components. An event source is a Kubernetes object that produces the event, and a sink is another Kubernetes object that receives the event. The workflow application can act as a source, a sink, or both in Knative Eventing platform. You need to add the Kogito Knative Eventing add-on dependency to indicate that you are using Knative Eventing. To enable a workflow to use Knative Eventing, add the following dependency to the pom.xml file of your project: Apache Maven Quarkus CLI Manually mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=\"kie-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing\" quarkus extension add kie-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing If you have used the Knative workflow CLI to create your project, then the Kogito Knative Eventing extension is already present. For more information about creating a project using Knative workflow CLI, see SonataFlow plug-in for Knative CLI. The Kogito Knative Eventing add-on takes care of the required dependencies and additional configuration that the workflow application needs, to interact with the Knative Eventing platform. Although the default configuration that the Quarkus Knative Eventing add-on provides ought to be enough for most of the use cases, sometimes you might need to do additional configuration to serve a specific scenario. The configuration described in this section is useful if your workflow consists of at least one produced type event definition. In this scenario, the workflow application produces events that act as a Knative source. HTTP transport configuration Knative injects the K_SINK environment variable in the workflow application when you deploy the application in the cluster. SonataFlow uses the K_SINK environment variable to address the produced events to the correct Knative sink. For more information, see SinkBinding in Knative Eventing documentation. The following table lists the HTTP transport configuration properties: Table 1. HTTP transport configuration properties Property Default value Description mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.url ${K_SINK:http://localhost:9090} This property indicates where to POST the HTTP CloudEvent message. mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.connector quarkus-http This property indicates the Quarkus Smallrye channel implementation. You might not need to change this property. If the K_SINK variable is not present, then the default value is http://localhost:9000. You can override the default value in development environments. Health check configuration By default, the workflow application generates a health check probe to verify if the Knative platform injected a valid K_SINK variable. If the K_SINK variable is not present, then the pod is not in the state of receiving requests. The following table lists the health check probe configuration property: Table 2. Health check probe configuration property Property Default value Description org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.health_enabled true This property indicates if the health check is enabled to verify that the K_SINK variable is injected into the environment. Knative target sink generation configuration The Kogito Knative Eventing add-on generates a few Knative objects during build time. By default, the add-on generates a Knative Broker named default if the workflow application is acting as an event source. The following table lists the configuration properties related to Knative sink generation: Table 3. Knative sink generation configuration properties Property Default value Description org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.auto_generate_broker true This property indicates if the Kogito Knative Eventing add-on generates a default Knative Broker in memory to sink and dispatch the messages. Set this property to false in case a broker is already installed in your namespace. Note that you can use org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.sink.* property to configure your custom sink. If this property is not set, then the auto-generated broker works as a sink. org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.sink.namespace This property indicates the namespace where the generated Knative sink is deployed. org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.sink.api_version eventing.knative.dev/v1 This property indicates the API group and version of the generated Knative sink. org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.sink.name default This property indicates the name of the generated Knative sink. org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.sink.kind Broker This property indicates the Kubernetes kind of the generated Knative sink. The configuration described in this section is useful if your workflow consists of at least one consumed type event definition. In this scenario, the workflow application consumes events, acting as a Knative sink. When the workflow application needs to consume events, the Knative Eventing add-on generates Knative triggers. The Knative triggers are configured to listen to a broker with the required event type, which is defined in your workflow definition. The following table lists the configuration property related to Knative sink generation: Table 4. Knative sink generation configuration property Property Default value Description org.kie.kogito.addons.knative.eventing.broker default This property indicates the name of the default Knative broker that is deployed in the Kubernetes namespace. This broker is used as the reference to create the Knative triggers, which are responsible to delegate the events that the workflow service consumes. mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.path / (root path) This property indicates the HTTP path where the workflow application will listen for the CloudEvents in the default incoming channel. mp.messaging.incoming..path / (root path) This property indicates the HTTP path where the workflow application will listen for the CloudEvents in the specific given channel name. The channel name is the event type as defined in the Serverless Workflow events definition. You can send HTTP CloudEvents to the workflow application endpoint by using any tool that’s capable to produce HTTP requests. The only requirement is that the request conforms to the CloudEvents specification. For example, with the help of curl, you can send an event to the workflow using the following command: Sending a CloudEvent over HTTP using the structured format. curl -X POST \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json' \\ -d '{\"datacontenttype\": \"application/json\", \"specversion\":\"1.0\",\"id\":\"41495513-a9ef-4a81-8479-21bb14db61f0\",\"source\":\"/local/curl\",\"type\":\"kogito.serverless.loanbroker.aggregated.quotes.response\",\"data\": { \"amount\": 300000, \"term\": 30, \"credit\": { \"score\": 700, \"history\": 15 }, \"quotes\": [{ \"bankId\": \"Bank1\", \"rate\": 12.2 }, {\"bankId\": \"Bank2\", \"rate\": 10}] } } ' \\ http://localhost:8080 In this example we are using the CloudEvents structured format, which includes every event information within the request payload. Note the header Content-Type being application/cloudevents+json. Alternatively, you can use the CloudEvents binary format, which includes the event metadata in the HTTP header. For example, using the same event as before: Sending a CloudEvent over HTTP using the binary format. curl -X POST -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'ce-specversion: 1.0' \\ -H 'ce-id: 41495513-a9ef-4a81-8479-21bb14db61f0' \\ -H 'ce-source: /local/curl' \\ -H 'ce-type: kogito.serverless.loanbroker.aggregated.quotes.response' \\ -d '{ \"amount\": 300000, \"term\": 30, \"credit\": { \"score\": 700, \"history\": 15 }, \"quotes\": [{ \"bankId\": \"Bank1\", \"rate\": 12.2 }, {\"bankId\": \"Bank2\", \"rate\": 10}] }' \\ http://localhost:8080/ You can use this tool to test your SonataFlow application locally and verify if the events are being consumed correctly by the workflow. For more information about testing incoming and outgoing CloudEvents over HTTP, see Mocking HTTP CloudEvents sink using WireMock. SonataFlow can generate Knative objects during the workflow application build time to facilitate the deployment in a Kubernetes cluster. However, you do not need to use the generated objects if you plan to create and deploy the Knative objects by yourself. Prerequisites A workflow application with the Knative Eventing add-on is created. Procedure Add the following Quarkus Kubernetes extension dependency to the pom.xml file of your project: Apache Maven Quarkus CLI Manually mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=\"quarkus-kubernetes,quarkus-container-image-jib\" quarkus extension add quarkus-kubernetes quarkus-container-image-jib io.quarkus quarkus-kubernetes io.quarkus quarkus-container-image-jib Add the quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=knative property to your application.properties file. Build your workflow application using the following command: Apache Maven Quarkus CLI Knative CLI mvn clean install quarkus build kn workflow build --image= The target/kubernetes directory contains two files including knative.yml and kogito.yml. The knative.yml file contains the Knative service representing the workflow application. The kogito.yml file contains the required objects to connect the workflow application to the Knative Eventing platform. You can use the generated files to deploy the workflow application in the Kubernetes cluster using the following command: Kubernetes command line tool Knative CLI kubectl apply -f target/kogito.yml kubectl apply -f target/knative.yml kn workflow deploy For more information about building and deploying the workflow application, see Building workflow images using Quarkus CLI. A workflow must contain at least one event definition for the Knative Eventing add-on to generate the event binding objects. The following is an example of a workflow containing produced and consumed events: Example of a workflow with produced and consumed events { \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"requestQuote\", \"type\": \"kogito.sw.request.quote\", \"kind\": \"produced\" }, { \"name\": \"aggregatedQuotesResponse\", \"type\": \"kogito.loanbroker.aggregated.quotes.response\", \"kind\": \"consumed\", \"source\": \"/kogito/serverless/loanbroker/aggregator\" }] } A workflow application with events definition needs a Knative SinkBinding to configure the target sink. The target sink is where the produced events (kogito.sw.request.quote event in the previous example) are dispatched. In this case, the Knative Eventing add-on generates an object as shown in the following example: Example of a Knative SinkBinding generated by the add-on apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1 kind: SinkBinding metadata: name: sb-loanbroker-flow spec: sink: ref: apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Broker name: default namespace: \"\" subject: apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1 kind: Service name: loanbroker-flow Regardless of the number of produced events in the workflow definition, only one SinkBinding is generated. When you define multiple events, ensure that your sink is a Knative Broker. The listener services can configure the subscriptions or triggers to consume the events from the broker. For the kogito.loanbroker.aggregated.quotes.response event in a previous example, the Knative Eventing platform must be configured with a Knative trigger using an appropriate CloudEvent filter. The following example shows the Trigger generated by the Knative Eventing add-on: Example of a Knative Trigger generated by the add-on apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1 kind: Trigger metadata: name: kogito-serverless-loanbroker-aggregated-quotes-response-trigger spec: broker: default filter: attributes: type: kogito.loanbroker.aggregated.quotes.response subscriber: ref: apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1 kind: Service name: loanbroker-flow For each consumed event definition, the Knative Eventing add-on generates one Knative Trigger.

Apache Kafka uses an abstraction called topic to classify events. Events are published to a topic, and events are consumed from a topic. SonataFlow uses Smallrye connectors to encapsulate access to several brokers, enabling SonataFlow to support different brokers by changing the configuration and classpath dependencies. However, Smallrye connectors also introduce an entity called channel. The Smallrye channels are unidirectional and need to be declared as input (incoming) or output (outgoing). When using Apache Kafka, the Smallrye channels must be mapped to Apache Kafka topics through configuration. You need to add the Kafka Quarkus Smallrye connector dependency to indicate that you are using Apache Kafka. To enable a workflow to use Apache Kafka Smallrye connector, add the following dependency to the pom.xml file of your project if using Apache Maven: Add dependency for Apache Kafka Smallrye connector in pom.xml io.quarkus quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka The messaging capabilities are included in the Quarkus Serverless Workflow extension, even though the messaging capabilities are optional. This means you do not need to explicitly add the messaging add-on dependency when using SonataFlow. You can configure Smallrye channels for a workflow using event definitions. The Smallrye channels are defined using Quarkus configuration. The format for Smallrye channel properties is mp.messaging.[incoming|outgoing]... SonataFlow allows the following channel mapping strategies: Define one default incoming channel to receive all the incoming messages and one default outgoing channel to store all the published messages. Define a channel for each CloudEvent type so that every message type has a dedicated channel. Define a channel for certain CloudEvent types. The non-mapped CloudEvent types uses the default incoming or outgoing channel. SonataFlow first searches for a channel name in the properties that is same as CloudEvent type. If the channel name is found, SonataFlow uses the channel for that CloudEvent type. However, if the channel name is not found, SonataFlow searches for the default channel definition. In case the default channel definition is not existing, then an error is reported. The default incoming channel is kogito_incoming_stream and the default outgoing channel is kogito_outgoing_stream. To change the default incoming and outgoing topic names, you can use the following properties: Properties to change default incoming and outgoing topic names kogito.addon.messaging.incoming.defaultName= kogito.addon.messaging.outgoing.defaultName= The following properties are mandatory for each channel: connector: This property needs to be set to smallrye-kafka. Depending on whether the channel is incoming or outgoing: value.deserializer: This property is used for incoming channels. Unless you have specific marshaling requirements, you must set this property to org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArrayDeserializer or org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer. value.serializer: This property is used for outgoing channels. Unless you have specific marshaling requirements, you must set this property to org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.ByteArraySerializer or org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer. topic is another relevant but optional property that might be set for a channel. The topic property contains the Apache Kafka topic name to be used for a channel. If topic property is not set, then the channel name is used as topic name. For more information about the properties that you can use for a channel when using Apache Kafka connector, see the properties list. This section describes examples of channel mapping, using the properties mentioned in the previous section. One Smallrye channel per CloudEvent type The serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus example application uses two CloudEvent types, including wait (incoming) and resume (outgoing). Kafka topic names match the CloudEvent types. Therefore, it is suitable to select the mapping strategy of one channel per CloudEvent type. This suggests that two channels must be configured. Note that you do not need to set the optional topic property as the channel name matches the CloudEvent type. Example property configuration mp.messaging.incoming.wait.connector=smallrye-kafka mp.messaging.incoming.wait.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer mp.messaging.outgoing.resume.connector=smallrye-kafka mp.messaging.outgoing.resume.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer Default channel mapping The serverless-workflow-events-quarkus example application uses two CloudEvent types, including applicants (incoming) and decisions (outgoing). As mentioned before, Kafka topic names match the CloudEvent types. However, to use the default channel functionality, kogito_incoming_stream and kogito_outgoing_stream are used as channel names. As explained before, since there is no specific channel name for the CloudEvent type, then the default channels are used. Also, the default channels need to be mapped to the desired topic name using the topic property. Example property configuration mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.connector=smallrye-kafka mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.topic=applicants mp.messaging.incoming.kogito_incoming_stream.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.connector=smallrye-kafka mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.topic=decisions mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer Smallrye provide means to manage emitter overflow through OnOverflow annotation Kogito will annotate generated smallrye emitters for a particular channel using the information provided by a property of the form kogito.addon.messaging.emitter..overflow-strategy. The possible values are BUFFER, NONE, UNBOUNDED, FAIL, and DROP. If the value of the strategy is BUFFER, then you must specify the buffer size by using the property of the form kogito.addon.messaging.emitter..buffer-size Therefore, for the wait channel, in the previous example, if we want to buffer as many as 100 events we will add these two properties Example overflow configuration kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.wait.overflow-strategy=BUFFER kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.wait.buffer-size=100 If all your channels use the same strategy and this strategy differs from the BUFFER one (you can change buffer size globally by using the mp.messaging.emitter.default-buffer-size smallrye property). You can set it up by using kogito.addon.messaging.emitter.overflow-strategy=NONE|UNBOUNDED|FAIL|DROP Consuming and producing events on Knative Eventing Event correlation in SonataFlow Callback state in SonataFlow If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

The figure below illustrates the overall architecture of this use case. Once a new subscription request comes, the flow will evaluate if it’s not already subscribed. If not, it will attempt to subscribe to the newsletter, the new user and wait for the confirmation. Once a new event containing the confirmation arrives, the flow will resume and proceed with the new user subscription. Subscriptions not confirmed during a configured period are considered timed-out and automatically removed from the system. By the end, a new event containing the details of the subscription is broadcast in the environment, so other actors can react to it. Here we have the Newsletter Subscription workflow: Figure 1. newsletter-subscription-flow workflow Newsletter subscription flow workflow definition { \"id\": \"subscription_flow\", \"dataInputSchema\": \"subscription-schema.json\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"start\": \"VerifyEmail\", \"events\": [ { \"kind\": \"produced\", \"type\": \"new.subscription\", \"name\": \"NewSubscriptionEvent\" }, { \"kind\": \"consumed\", \"type\": \"confirm.subscription\", \"name\": \"ConfirmSubscriptionEvent\" } ], \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"subscribeToNewsletter\", \"operation\": \"specs/subscription-service.yaml#subscribe\" }, { \"name\": \"confirmSubscription\", \"operation\": \"specs/subscription-service.yaml#confirm\" }, { \"name\": \"deleteSubscription\", \"operation\": \"specs/subscription-service.yaml#delete\" }, { \"name\": \"verifyEmail\", \"operation\": \"specs/subscription-service.yaml#verify\" } ], \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"VerifyEmail\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"verifyEmail\", \"arguments\": { \"email\": \"${ .email }\" } } } ], \"transition\": { \"nextState\": \"ExitIfEmailExists\" } }, { \"name\": \"ExitIfEmailExists\", \"type\": \"switch\", \"dataConditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"${ .emailExists == true }\", \"transition\": { \"nextState\": \"NoSubscription\" } }, { \"condition\": \"${ .emailExists == false }\", \"transition\": { \"nextState\": \"SubscribeAndWaitForConfirmation\" } } ] }, { \"name\": \"SubscribeAndWaitForConfirmation\", \"type\": \"callback\", \"action\": { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subscribeToNewsletter\", \"arguments\": { \"email\": \"${ .email }\", \"id\": \"$WORKFLOW.instanceId\", \"name\": \"${ .name }\" } } }, \"eventRef\": \"ConfirmSubscriptionEvent\", \"transition\": { \"nextState\": \"CheckConfirmation\" }, \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT3M\" } }, { \"name\" : \"CheckConfirmation\", \"type\" : \"switch\", \"dataConditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"${ .confirmed == true }\", \"transition\": \"ConfirmSubscription\" } ], \"defaultCondition\": { \"transition\": \"DeleteSubscription\" } }, { \"name\": \"ConfirmSubscription\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"confirmSubscription\", \"arguments\": { \"email\": \"${ .email }\", \"id\": \"$WORKFLOW.instanceId\", \"name\": \"${ .name }\" } } } ], \"end\": { \"produceEvents\": [ { \"eventRef\": \"NewSubscriptionEvent\" } ], \"terminate\": true } }, { \"name\": \"DeleteSubscription\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"deleteSubscription\", \"arguments\": { \"id\": \"$WORKFLOW.instanceId\" } } } ], \"end\": true }, { \"name\": \"NoSubscription\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"subscribed\": true }, \"end\": true } ] } The newsletter-subscription example involves two services: Newsletter subscription application. It allows you to create new subscriptions and runs the workflow. Newsletter subscription Backend. It allows you to see the pending and approved subscriptions Both services provide specific user interfaces to allow to track what’s going on with the subscriptions As a Quarkus project, you can place the UI resources in the src/main/resources/META-INF/resources folder. The Newsletter Subscription Application (subscription-flow) has a user interface to interact with the workflow without having to rely on the command line to push events or make HTTP requests: The used resources are available at Newsletter Subscription Application flow UI resources. Figure 2. Newsletter subscription user interface The Newsletter Subscription backend (subscription-service) has a user interface to see the state of the existing subscriptions The used resources are available at Subscription service UI resources. Figure 3. Newsletter subscription backend user interface In a command terminal, clone the incubator-kie-kogito-examples repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow these steps: git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples.git cd incubator-kie-kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-newsletter-subscription The following diagram shows the architecture for this use case: Whenever a workflow needs to program a timer for a given timeout, a cloud event is sent to the job service for that purpose. When a timer is overdue, a rest call is executed to notify the workflow, which then must execute according to the given state semantic. Workflow and job status changes are propagated to the data index service via cloud events. Figure 4. Knative Workflow with Job Service architecture subscription-flow: Is the Quarkus Workflow Project that contains the workflows that must be maven built, and deployed into the kubernetes cluster. subscription-service: Is the Quarkus Workflow Project that contains the backend operations, that must be maven built, and deployed into the kubernetes cluster. jobs-service-postresql: Is the job service that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster. data-index-service-postgresql: Is the data index service that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster. timeouts-showcase-database: Is the PostgreSQL instance that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster. For simplification purposes, a single database instance is used for both services to store the information about the workflow instances, and the timers. However, in a production environment, it is recommended to have independent database instances.

For more information about Saga pattern, see the initial publication. In a microservice architecture, you can define a participant as microservice, which is responsible to perform actions related to the business domain. The Saga pattern manages the transactions using a sequence of steps. If a failure occurs while executing a step, then a sequence of compensating actions is executed to undo the changes that are made during the execution. As an alternative, you can leave the system in a known termination state to be consistent. To understand the implementation of Saga pattern in a workflow, you can use the serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus example application in GitHub repository. The serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus example application is based on the order fulfillment process and describes how to define the Saga pattern using SonataFlow. In the order fulfillment example, a user buys an item from an e-commerce application. The user adds the delivery information and payment details, and waits for the item to be delivered. The following figure shows the sequence of steps that are executed to complete an order: Figure 1. Example of order fulfillment process The previous figure contains the following steps: Order checkout: User confirms the order with selected items, payment method, and delivery address. Stock reservation: The selected items in the order are reserved in the stock. Payment processing: Payment is processed based on the selected payment method and user information. For example, in case of processing payment using credit card, then the credit is verified and allocated to the payment. Shipping processing: The shipping processing represents a mechanism, which communicates with a third-party or an internal system who are responsible for logistics and delivery. The following figure describes the Saga pattern using the success and failure workflows in the order fulfillment process: Figure 2. Example of Saga pattern in Order fulfillment process The success workflow in the previous figure consists of the following steps: Reserve item stock Process the payment Schedule the order shipping However, in the failure workflow an error occurred during the shipping process. In this situation, a sequence of compensation actions is executed, including canceling the payment and releasing the stock for the items in the order. In the serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus example application, a workflow is used that implements the Saga pattern, in which all the steps and compensation actions are defined. Also, the workflow plays the role of Saga Executor Coordinator (SEC), which orchestrates the calls to the participants in the Saga pattern. The workflow definition used to define the Saga pattern is available in the order-saga-error-handling.sw.json file. Figure 3. Example of order fulfillment Saga workflow In the previous example figure of workflow, the calls are orchestrated to the participants (for example, order service, payment service), each participant can throw possible errors, and compensations for each step are defined, that are executed once an error appears during the workflow execution. To define the interactions among participants in the Saga pattern using Serverless Workflow specification, you can use workflow states with transitions. In Serverless Workflow specification, each workflow state represents a step to be completed in the Saga pattern. Also, an action associated with the workflow state represents how a participant is invoked to execute a given step. Example of workflow state declaration representing the payment process in Saga { \"name\":\"processPayment\", \"type\":\"operation\", \"actions\":[ { \"name\":\"processPaymentAction\", \"functionRef\":{ \"refName\":\"processPayment\", \"arguments\":{ \"orderId\":\".orderId\", \"failService\":\".failService\" } }, \"actionDataFilter\":{ \"results\":\".\", \"toStateData\":\".paymentResponse\" } } ], \"transition\":\"scheduleShipping\", \"compensatedBy\":\"CancelPayment\", \"onErrors\":[ { \"errorRef\":\"process payment failed\", \"transition\":\"ServiceError\" } ] } In the previous example, the processPayment state contains a processPaymentAction action, which invokes a function to execute the payment processing that Payment Service participant might process. The transition attribute represents the next step to be started, which schedules the order shipping for the Saga pattern. Compensation actions When designing a Saga pattern, compensation actions for each step is considered as a core functionality, which is executed by a participant. In SonataFlow each workflow state must define a compensation action using compensatedBy attribute, indicating another workflow state that performs the compensation action. For example, in serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus, processPayment state defines CancelPayment as a compensation action in the payment process. Example of defining a compensation action \"compensatedBy\": \"CancelPayment\" Errors In SonataFlow errors are identified by a name and can be associated with a workflow state. For example, a process payment failed error is associated with the processPayment state. Following is an example of error declaration in the workflow definition: Example the error declaration for the Saga { \"errors\":[ { \"name\":\"reserve stock failed\", \"code\":\"org.kie.kogito.ServiceException\" }, { \"name\":\"process payment failed\", \"code\":\"org.kie.kogito.ServiceException\" }, { \"name\":\"shipping failed\", \"code\":\"org.kie.kogito.ServiceException\" } ] } Once an error occurs during the workflow execution, the associated compensation action is triggered. An error definition uses the fully qualified class name (FQCN) for Java exceptions that are thrown by functions. In the previous example of error definition, org.kie.kogito.ServiceException is thrown by the service calls that are defined as Java methods in the PaymentService.java file. Example custom function using a Java class and method { \"name\":\"reserveStock\", \"type\":\"custom\", \"operation\":\"service:org.kie.kogito.PaymentService::processPayment\" } The function that are throwing errors can be any type of functions, such as REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC. For information about error handling, see Error handling in SonataFlow. The workflow engine controls the execution of the flow and keeps the track of the steps that need to be compensated. Also, the engine ensures that compensated states are executed in reverse order of each completed step. The engine is a stateful, allowing Saga to contain wait states, such as callbacks. After each wait state, the workflow is persisted and can continue once it receives a request or event. The serverless-workflow-saga-quarkus example application shows a Saga workflow that is executed as request-response. This is called a straight through process, in which an entire workflow is executed in a single request. You can use the following examples as a reference to run and test the Saga pattern in a workflow: Create new success order You can use the following example to send a request for creating an order: Example request to create an order curl -L -X POST \"http://localhost:8080/order_saga_error_workflow\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{ \"orderId\": \"03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa\" }' Example response { \"id\":\"b5c0bf16-1e37-4d7a-82cd-610809090d9c\", \"workflowdata\":{ \"orderId\":\"03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa\", \"stockResponse\":{ \"type\":\"SUCCESS\", \"resourceId\":\"dc32abe6-9706-4061-8e96-910d8e06728d\" }, \"paymentResponse\":{ \"type\":\"SUCCESS\", \"resourceId\":\"505259d9-1c12-40ea-af5d-679e2cd89394\" }, \"shippingResponse\":{ \"type\":\"SUCCESS\", \"resourceId\":\"d6e2d538-0229-4b8e-a363-17ebabdb3585\" }, \"orderResponse\":{ \"type\":\"SUCCESS\", \"resourceId\":\"03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa\" } } } The response contains the workflow data with nested attributes, which represent the responses from the execution of each step including success or failure. In the previous example, the orderResponse attribute indicates if the order can be confirmed by the client by initiating the Saga workflow. Therefore, if the value of the orderResponse attribute is success, then the order can be confirmed, otherwise the order can be canceled. When executing the application, you can also verify the log with information related to the executed steps as shown in the following example: Example console output 2022-06-24 13:44:36,666 INFO [org.kie.kog.StockService] (executor-thread-0) Reserve Stock for order 03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa 2022-06-24 13:44:36,669 INFO [org.kie.kog.PaymentService] (executor-thread-0) Process Payment for order 03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa 2022-06-24 13:44:36,673 INFO [org.kie.kog.ShippingService] (executor-thread-0) Schedule Shipping for order 03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa 2022-06-24 13:44:36,676 INFO [org.kie.kog.OrderService] (executor-thread-0) Order Success 03e6cf79-3301-434b-b5e1-d6899b5639aa Activate compensation actions To test the workflow, an optional failService attribute is introduced, indicating which participant must respond with an error.

Optionally, you can set the following properties to specify the image: quarkus.container-image.registry: To define the registry address of the image, such as quay.io. When using OpenShift use the provided registry. quarkus.container-image.group: To define the registry namespace of the image. For example, context/namespace or in case of Kubernetes or OpenShift namespace/project. quarkus.container-image.name: To override the image name. By default, this property uses artifact ID. Build your workflow application with specific image information quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io The added Jib extension caches the target/lib directory. Based on the size of your project, Jib speeds up the rebuilds. You can also push your workflow application to the defined registry. You need to set the quarkus.container-image.push property value to true (default value is false). Example of pushing the built workflow application to a registry quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=sonataflow \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true The previous command results in the following container image pushed to quay.io: quay.io/sonataflow/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 Alternatively, you can create an Apache Maven profile to build the container image, which can be triggered by setting the target profile. Example Apache Maven profile build-container true kogito serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.0 quay.io true You can activate the created Apache Maven profile using Quarkus CLI: Activate the Apache Maven profile quarkus build -- -Pbuild-container When it comes to workflows, a small startup footprint is expected, which can be better when using the native builds to build a workflow application. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build a native image, pass the --native flag using Quarkus CLI: Example of building a native image quarkus build --native -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0-native \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native In case GraalVM is not installed, you can set the -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true system property, which creates a Linux executable. Configure Docker to use the in-cluster (Remote) Docker daemon When you are building Container Images using a remote Docker Daemon, i.e. Minikube, you need to use the following system property instead of -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true System property to use a remote Docker Daemon -Dquarkus.native.remote-container-build=true For more information about native builds, see Building a native executable. Once you have the container image of you SonataFlow application, you can proceed to deployments or start testing it locally.

We will also use Quarkus dev mode for iterative development and testing. As a common application development, you have different phases like Analysis, Development and Deployment. Let’s explore in detail each phase and what SonataFlow provides in each case: Analysis and taking decisions phase Adding persistence? Adding eventing? Adding Data Index service? Adding Job service? Development phase Bootstrapping a project, Creating a workflow, Running your workflow application and Testing your workflow application How to configure logging Refine your workflow testing with Dev-UI Deployment phase Prerequisites You have set up your environment according to the advanced environment setup guide. For more information about the tooling and the required dependencies, see Getting familiar with SonataFlow tooling. Start by analyzing the requirements for your SonataFlow application. This will enable you to make decisions about the persistence, eventing, security, topology, and component interaction needs of your application. Service orchestration is a relevant use case regarding the rise of microservices and event-driven architectures. These architectures focus on communication between services and there is always the need to coordinate that communication without the persistence addition requirement. SonataFlow applications use an in-memory persistence by default. This makes all the workflow instance information volatile upon runtime restarts. In the case of this guide, when the workflow runtime is restarted. As a developer, you must decide if you need to ensure that your workflow instances remain consistent in the context. If your application requires persistence, you must decide what kind of persistence is needed and configure it properly. Follow the SonataFlow persistence guide for more information. You can find more information about how to create an application that writes to and reads from a database following Your second Quarkus application guide. Quarkus unifies reactive and imperative programming you can find more information about this in the Quarkus Reactive Architecture guide. In this phase, we must decide how the Event-Driven Architecture needs to be added to our project. As an event-driven architecture, it uses events to trigger and communicate between services. It allows decoupled applications to publish and subscribe to events through an event broker asynchronously. The event-driven architecture is a method of developing systems that allows information to flow in real time between applications, microservices, and connected devices. This means that applications and devices do not need to know where they are sending information or where the information they are consuming comes from. If we choose to add eventing, SonataFlow supports different options like: Kafka Connector for Reactive Messaging. See Consuming and producing events using Apache Kafka in Quarkus for more details. Knative eventing. See Consuming and producing events on Knative Eventing in Quarkus for more details. You must choose how the different project components will communicate and what kind of communication is needed. More details about Quarkus Extensions enabling Reactive The Data Index service can index the workflow instance information using GraphQL. This is very useful if you want to consume the workflow data in different applications through a GraphQL endpoint. For more information about Data Index service see Data Index Core Concepts for more details. If you decide to index the data, you must select how to integrate the Data Index service in your topology. Here are some options: You can choose to have the data indexation service integrated directly into our application using the different Data Index Quarkus extensions. This allows you to use the same data source as the application persistence uses, without the need for extra service deployment. Data Index persistence extension. That persists the indexed data directly at the application data source. Data Index extension. That persist directly the indexed data at the application data source and also provide the GraphQL endpoint to interact with the persisted data. Another option is to have the Data Index as a standalone service. In this case, you must properly configure the communication between your SonataFlow application and the Data Index service. More details in Data Index standalone service The Job Service facilitates the scheduled execution of tasks in a cloud environment. If any of your SonataFlow workflow needs some kind of temporary schedule, you will need to integrate the Job service. If you decide to use Job Service, you need to select how to integrate the service into your topology. Here are some options: You can choose to have the Job service integrated directly into your SonataFlow Quarkus application using Job Service Quarkus Extensions guide. Explore how to integrate the Job service and define the interaction with your SonataFlow application workflows. You can find more Job service-related details in Job Service Core concepts. Once you decide which components you must integrate into SonataFlow project, you can jump into the workflow development phase. The goal is to create a workflow and be able to test and improve it. SonataFlow provides some tooling to facilitate the developer to try the workflows during this development phase and refine them before going to the deployment phase. As an overview, you have the following resources to help in this development phase: Bootstrapping a project, Creating a workflow, Running your workflow application and Testing your workflow application How to configure logging Refine your workflow testing with Dev-UI To create your workflow service, first you need to bootstrap a project. Follow the SonataFlow Creating a Quarkus Workflow service guide to setup a minimal working project. In order to understand what’s happening in the environment. SonataFlow is using Quarkus Log Management. Logs can provide a detailed history of what happened leading up to the issue. Quarkus uses the JBoss Log Manager logging backend for publishing application and framework logs. Quarkus supports the JBoss Logging API and multiple other logging APIs, seamlessly integrated with JBoss Log Manager In order to be able to see the in detail access to Quarkus Logging Configuration guide Example adding Logging configuration properties in application.properties file quarkus.log.console.enable=true (1) quarkus.log.level=INFO (2) quarkus.log.category.\"org.apache.kafka.clients\".level=INFO quarkus.log.category.\"org.apache.kafka.common.utils\".level=INFO (3) 1 If console logging should be enabled, even by default is set to true 2 The log level of the root category, which is used as the default log level for all categories 3 Logging is configured on a per-category basis, with each category being configured independently. Configuration for a category applies recursively to all subcategories unless there is a more specific subcategory configuration Access to Logging configuration reference to see how logs properties can be configured Quarkus provides a host of features when dev mode is enabled allowing things like: Change configuration values. Running Development services, including Zero-config setup of data sources. When testing or running in dev mode Quarkus can even provide you with a zero config database out of the box, a feature we refer to as Dev Services. More information can be found in Quarkus introduction to Dev services. Access to Swagger-UI that allows exploring the different SonataFlow application endpoints. The quarkus-smallrye-openapi extension will expose the Swagger UI when Quarkus is running in dev mode. Additional information can be found Use Swagger UI for development. Data index Graph UI that allows to perform GraphQL queries or to explore the data schema Allow to explore the workflow instances if the SonataFlow Runtime tools Quarkus Dev UI is included By default, Swagger UI is only available when Quarkus is started in dev or test mode. If you want to make it available in production too, you can include the following configuration in your application.properties: quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true This is a build time property, it cannot be changed at runtime after your application is built. At this stage you have a SonataFlow Quarkus application well tested and ready to be deployed. There are two basic modes that a Quarkus application can be deployed: As an standard Java application (executable jar with libraries on the classpath) As a native executable which can be built using GraalVM Quarkus Building a native executable guide If you put either the Java application or the native executable app inside a container, you can deploy the container anywhere that supports running containers. Quarkus provides extensions for building (and pushing) container images. You can find more details about that container images generation in Quarkus Container Image extensions Once this container image is built it can be used as part of the decided topology. You have different options like: Deploying your SonataFlow application on Minikube Deploying your SonataFlow application on Kubernetes Deploying your SonataFlow application on OpenShift Getting familiar with SonataFlow tooling Orchestrating the OpenAPI services Newsletter subscription example in SonataFlow Timeouts Showcase in SonataFlow If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

This document describes how to create a workflow application that serves a hello_world endpoint. The workflow contains the following two states: Inject Hello World: Injects a Hello World message into the response Inject Mantra: Injects a Mantra message into the response Figure 1. Example Hello World workflow Prerequisites You have set up your environment according to the advanced environment setup guide and your cluster is ready. For more information about the tooling and the required dependencies, see Getting familiar with SonataFlow tooling. To create your workflow service, first you need to bootstrap a project. Procedure In a command terminal, use one of the following commands to create a project: Quarkus CLI Apache Maven Knative workflow CLI Create a project using Quarkus CLI quarkus create app \\ -x=kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow \\ -x=quarkus-resteasy-jackson \\ -x=quarkus-smallrye-openapi \\ --no-code \\ org.acme:serverless-workflow-hello-world:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT The previous command creates a Maven Quarkus project in the serverless-workflow-hello-world directory containing the required dependencies, including: kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow: Adds support for workflows. quarkus-resteasy-jackson: Adds support for RESTEasy, which is required by the generated REST resources that are used to start the flow process using an HTTP request. quarkus-smallrye-openapi: Adds support for Swagger documentation when you run the application in development mode. --no-code: Prevents workflow example code from being generated. Create a project using Apache Maven mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:3.8.4:create \\ -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \\ -DprojectArtifactId=serverless-workflow-hello-world \\ -Dextensions=\"kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow,quarkus-resteasy-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi\" \\ -DnoCode In the previous command, org.acme, serverless-workflow-hello-world, and 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT is group ID, artifact ID, and version of your project respectively. -DnoCode prevents the generation of workflow example code. Create a project using Knative workflow CLI kn workflow quarkus create \\ --name serverless-workflow-hello-world \\ --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi \\ --quarkus-platform-group-id=io.quarkus.platform \\ --quarkus-version=3.8.4 For more information about Knative workflow CLI, see SonataFlow plug-in for Knative CLI. Navigate into the project directory. cd serverless-workflow-hello-world After bootstrapping a project, you need to create a workflow. In the following procedure, a workflow named Hello World Workflow is created. Procedure Create a file named hello.sw.json in the src/main/resources directory with the following content: Example content for hello.sw.json file { \"id\": \"hello_world\", (1) \"version\": \"1.0\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"name\": \"Hello World Workflow\", \"description\": \"JSON based hello world workflow\", \"start\": \"Inject Hello World\", (3) \"states\": [ (2) { \"name\": \"Inject Hello World\", \"type\": \"inject\", (4) \"data\": { (5) \"greeting\": \"Hello World\" }, \"transition\": \"Inject Mantra\" (6) }, { \"name\": \"Inject Mantra\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" (7) }, \"end\": true (8) } ] } In the previous example: 1 id field is the unique identifier of the workflow. SonataFlow generates the REST endpoints based on this unique identifier. 2 states defines the states of the workflow. In the Hello World example, the workflow contains two states, such as Inject Hello World and Inject Mantra. 3 start field defines the state in which the workflow starts. 4 type defines the type of the state. In the previous example, the state is inject. The inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. 5 data defines the data that is injected into the state. In the previous example, greeting is injected with the Hello World value. 6 transition field defines the next state that is reached after the current state is completed. 7 Injects a mantra with the value Serverless Workflow is awesome! into the workflow data. 8 end field defines that the current state is the end of the workflow. When the workflow reaches the end state, the workflow stops and the REST endpoint returns the workflow data, such as: Example workflow data { \"greeting\": \"Hello World\", \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" } The workflow definition follows the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification. For more information, see CNCF Serverless Workflow specification. To verify that project is created, compile the project using the following command: Quarkus CLI Apache Maven Knative workflow CLI Compile your project using Quarkus CLI quarkus build Compile your project using Apache Maven mvn clean package Build your project and generate a local image called dev.local/serverless-workflow-hello-world:latest kn workflow quarkus build --image dev.local/serverless-workflow-hello-world For more information about Knative workflow CLI, see SonataFlow plug-in for Knative CLI. After creating a workflow, you can run your workflow application. Procedure Enter the following command to run your workflow application: Quarkus CLI Apache Maven Knative workflow CLI Run your workflow application using Quarkus CLI quarkus dev Run your workflow application using Apache Maven mvn clean quarkus:dev Run your workflow application using Knative workflow CLI kn workflow quarkus run Note that once the project is ready, the Development UI will be opened up in a browser automatically (on http://localhost:8080/q/dev). You can avoid that by appending --open-dev-ui=false after the command. For more information about Knative workflow CLI, see SonataFlow plug-in for Knative CLI. The SwaggerUI is available at http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/ when you run the application.

It enables the workflow engine to identify and call Camel routes declared in YAML or XML in the same workflow project context. You can enable Quarkus Camel in your project. Prerequisites A workflow application is created. For more information about creating a workflow, see Creating your first workflow service. Procedure To add the Quarkus Camel to your workflow application, add the org.kie.kogito:kogito-addons-quarkus-camel dependency to the pom.xml file of your project as follows: Dependency to be added to the pom.xml file to enable metrics org.kie.kogito kogito-addons-quarkus-camel You can add YAML or XML Camel routes to your workflow project. Procedure Create a YAML or XML Camel Routes using your IDE or the Kaoto VS Code Editor and place them in the src/main/resources/routes directory. The route from endpoint must be a direct component. That’s the endpoint producer expected by the workflow engine. The route response must be in a valid format that the workflow context can understand: A string that contains a valid JSON object A valid Java bean that can be serialized to JSON A Jackson’s JsonNode object Any primitive type (Integer, Float, Decimal, String, etc) The response will be merged into the workflow state context. If it is an array or a complex object, the response will be added to the special attribute response. Example of a Camel route with the direct endpoint returning a valid JSON string representation - from: uri: direct:logRouteReplaceHeader (1) steps: (2) - setBody: simple: '{ \"id\": \"${header.WorkflowID}\", \"arg1\": { \"arg2\": \"value1\" } }' (3) - log: message: We received the ${body} (4) 1 Camel route producer definition using the direct component 2 Definition of the Camel route steps 3 Replace the Camel message body with a valid JSON object containing the header WorkflowID from the workflow context 4 Log the Camel message body in the console for debugging purposes. You can define and reference your Camel functions in the workflow definition. Prerequisites You have created Camel routes in the workflow Maven project. Procedure In the functions definition section of your workflow DSL, declare the Camel route as exemplified below: Example of a Camel Route function definition { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"logRoute\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"camel:direct:logRouteReplaceHeader\" } ] } The operation description must have the prefix camel:direct:, indicating that you want to produce a message to this route via the Camel Direct Component. Direct is the only component supported by SonataFlow at the moment. The operation suffix contains the name of the route endpoint. In the case of this example, logRouteReplaceHeader. The Camel route defined in the workflow must be available in your project during runtime, otherwise, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. To use the Camel function definition in a workflow action, you can simply reference it as you normally would with any other SonataFlow function definitions. For example: Example of a workflow state action referencing { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"sendToLog\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"logRoute\", (1) \"arguments\": { \"body\": \"${ . }\", (2) \"headers\": { \"WorkflowID\": \"$WORKFLOW.instanceId\" (3) } } } } ], \"end\": true } ] } 1 The function reference name, as defined in the function attribute. 2 The body definition. A jq expression to be evaluated in runtime resulting in the body payload. 3 The headers definition that must be a key/value pair or a valid jq expression evaluated in runtime. Once a message is received back from the Camel route, the data is merged into the workflow payload: Message payload example returned by the Camel route { \"id\": \"777adb97-d297-45fd-9969-efafe4dfb3e7\", \"arg1\": { \"arg2\": \"value1\" } } There is an example project available on GitHub using this new feature.

This example contains a simple workflow-service that illustrates callback state using OpenAPI callbacks functionality. A callback is a state that invokes an action and wait for an event (event that will be eventually fired by the external service notified by the action). This example consists of a callback state that waits for an event to arrive at the wait channel. Its action calls an external service named callback-event-service that publishes the wait event over HTTP. After consuming the wait event, the workflow prints the message received in the wait event and ends the workflow. The serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus application is initiated with the following request to http://localhost:8080/callback: { \"message\": \"Hello\" } Once the workflow is started, it makes an external service call with the callback URL and the workflow instance ID in the request body to callback-event-service. Then, as configured in the OpenAPI file, the callback URL is invoked to send a CloudEvent to the workflow. Once the wait type CloudEvent is received by the callback-workflow-service, the workflow moves to the next state and ends successfully. The following figure shows the serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus image: To use the OpenAPI callback in a workflow, the OpenAPI YAML file is configured with the callback as specified in the OpenAPI file. To use the Callback state in a workflow, first CloudEvent type wait is declared that the workflow uses. Following is an example of CloudEvents declaration in a workflow definition: Example of CloudEvent declaration in a workflow definition \"events\": [ { \"name\": \"waitEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"wait\" } After that, a Callback state is declared, which waits for a CloudEvent with the wait type. Following is an example of declaring a Callback state that handles the wait type CloudEvent: Example of a Callback State declaration handling the wait CloudEvent { \"name\": \"waitForEvent\", \"type\": \"callback\", \"action\": { \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"callBack\", \"arguments\": { \"uri\": \"http://localhost:8080/wait\", \"processInstanceId\": \"$WORKFLOW.instanceId\" } } }, \"eventRef\": \"waitEvent\", \"transition\": \"finish\" } Please refer configure openapi service endpoints document to set the URL dynamically using an environment variable. An event listener publishes a new wait type CloudEvent. Following is an example of a Java method that publishes the wait type CloudEvent: Example of a Java method that makes a call to Callback URL and publishes the wait CloudEvent @POST @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) public void wait(EventInput eventInput) throws JsonProcessingException { logger.info(\"About to generate event for {}\",eventInput); CloudEventBuilder builder = CloudEventBuilder.v1() .withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString()) .withSource(URI.create(\"\")) .withType(\"wait\") .withTime(OffsetDateTime.now()) .withExtension(CloudEventExtensionConstants.PROCESS_REFERENCE_ID, eventInput.getProcessInstanceId()) .withData(objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(Collections.singletonMap(\"message\", \"New Event\"))); webClient.postAbs(eventInput.getUri()).sendJson(builder.build()).toCompletionStage(); } The callback-workflow-service consumes the CloudEvent, it contains an attribute named kogitoprocrefid, which holds the instance ID of the workflow. The kogitoprocrefid attribute is crucial because when the correlation is not used, then this attribute is the only way for the Callback state to identify that the related CloudEvent needs to be used to resume the workflow. For more information about correlation, see Event correlation in SonataFlow. Note that each workflow is identified by a unique instance ID, which is automatically included in any published CloudEvent, as kogitoprocinstanceid CloudEvent extension. The serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus example application consumes the Cloudevents using Knative Eventing. For more information about incoming and outgoing CloudEvents oer HTTP, see Consuming and Producing CloudEvents over HTTP. The HTTP path where the workflow application will listen for the CloudEvents in the serverless-workflow-callback-events-over-http-quarkus example application, is configured in the application.properties file as shown below: mp.messaging.incoming.wait.connector=quarkus-http mp.messaging.incoming.wait.path=/wait Event correlation in SonataFlow Example of SonataFlow application using OpenAPI callback events with Quarkus If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

The code appearing in this document is copied from serverless-workflow-python-quarkus example application and PythonService integration test. To enable Python support, you must add the Python add-on dependency to your SonataFlow module pom.xml file org.apache.kie.sonataflow sonataflow-addons-quarkus-python SonataFlow supports the execution of Python script in the same memory address as the running workflow. To invoke a Python script the first step is to define a custom Python function at the beginning of the flow. \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"python\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"script:python\" } ] Once done, you can use that function several times to execute arbitrary Python code. The Python code is provided as an argument of the function call through the script property. \"functionRef\": \"refName\": \"python\", \"arguments\": { \"script\": \"import numpy as np\" } } Previous snippet imports numpy library. The same Python function can be invoked again to generate an array containing three random numbers between 0 and 10. \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"python\", \"arguments\": { \"script\": \"rng = np.random.default_rng().integers(low=0,high=10,size=3)\" } } To access the result of the embedded python invocation, SonataFlow provides a special context variable: $WORKFLOW.python. Therefore, if you want to set the rng variable from the previous script as the output property of the workflow model, you write \"stateDataFilter\" : { \"output\" : \"{result:$WORKFLOW.python.rng}\" } You can also invoke functions from standard or custom python modules. You must define a serverless workflow function definition that invokes the Python function. You should specify, within the operation property, the name of the Python module and function to be invoked when the function is called. You should separate the module name and the function name using :: and prefix them with services::python: The following example defines a function that invokes a standard Python function math.factorial(x) \"functions\" : [ { \"name\" : \"factorial\", \"operation\" : \"service:python:math::factorial\", \"type\" : \"custom\" } Once you have defined the function, you might call it passing the expected arguments. In the case of factorial, an integer stored in property x of the workflow model. \"functionRef\" : { \"refName\": \"factorial\", \"arguments\" : \".x\" } The return value of the function can be handled as any other function result using the actionDataFilter.toStateData Serverless Workflow construct. The following will set a workflow model property called result with the factorial invocation returned value. \"actionDataFilter\" : { \"toStateData\" : \".result\" } The Openvino illustrates the powerful AI capabilities of integrating workflows with Python.

This document describes how you can enable and expose the generated metrics to Prometheus. You can enable the metrics in your workflow application. Prerequisites A workflow application is created. For more information about creating a workflow, see Creating your first workflow service. Procedure To add the metrics to your workflow application, add the org.kie:kie-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus dependency to the pom.xml file of your project: Dependency to be added to the pom.xml file to enable metrics org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus Rebuild your workflow application. The metrics is available at /q/metrics endpoint. After enabling the metrics in SonataFlow, the generated metrics can be consumed from OpenShift, Kubernetes, and Prometheus to visualize on different dashboard tools. If your workflow server is running on OpenShift, then you can use the server to monitor your workflow application. Also, you can perform the task of consuming metrics from OpenShift. Prerequisites Metrics is enabled in SonataFlow. For more information, see Enabling metrics in SonataFlow. Procedure To consume metrics from OpenShift, enable monitoring for user-defined projects. For more information, see Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects in OpenShift documentation. When you enable monitoring for user-defined projects, the Prometheus Operator is installed automatically. Create a service monitor as shown in the following configuration: Example configuration in service-monitor.yaml apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: labels: k8s-app: prometheus-app-monitor name: prometheus-app-monitor namespace: my-project spec: endpoints: - interval: 30s targetPort: 8080 path: /q/metrics scheme: http selector: matchLabels: app-with-metrics: 'serverless-workflow-app' Run the following command to apply the service monitor: Apply service monitor oc apply -f service-monitor.yaml In the previous procedure, a service monitor named prometheus-app-monitor is created, which selects applications containing the label as app-with-metrics: serverless-workflow-app. Ensure that your workflow application contains the same label. After that, Prometheus sends request to the /q/metrics endpoint for all the services that are labeled with app-with-metrics: serverless-workflow-app every 30 seconds. For more information about monitoring Quarkus application using Micrometer and Prometheus into OpenShift, see Quarkus - Micrometer Metrics. Consuming metrics from Kubernetes is similar to OpenShift. However, you need to install the Prometheus Operator project manually. For more information about installing Prometheus Operator, see Prometheus Operator website. If your workflow server is running on Prometheus, then you can perform the task of consuming metrics from Prometheus and visualize the workflow on different dashboard tools. Prerequisites Metrics is enabled in SonataFlow. For more information, see Enabling metrics in SonataFlow. Procedure Use the following configuration to enable Prometheus to remove metrics directly from the workflow application: Example Prometheus configuration - job_name: 'Serverless Workflow App' scrape_interval: 2s metrics_path: /q/metrics static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:8080'] Replace the values of job_name and scrap_interval in the previous configuration with your own values. Ensure that target under static_configs parameter in Prometheus configuration matches with your workflow application location. For more information about configuring Prometheus, see Configure Prometheus to monitor the sample targets in Prometheus Getting Started document. In SonataFlow, you can check the following metrics: kogito_process_instance_started_total: Number of started workflows. kogito_process_instance_running_total: Number of running workflows. kogito_process_instance_completed_total: Number of completed workflows. kogito_process_instance_error: Number of workflows that report an error. kogito_process_instance_duration_seconds: Duration of a workflow instance in seconds. kogito_node_instance_duration_milliseconds: Duration of relevant nodes in milliseconds. sonataflow_input_parameters_counter_total: Records input parameters, the occurrences of per processId.

To build the dashboards, you need data, which you can acquire from your workflows using one of the following methods: Enable metrics Integrate with Data Index to consume data using the REST API Use custom mechanisms, such as ProcessInstanceListener The following sections describes the process of creating dashboards using metrics and Data Index GraphQL REST API. The dashboards for workflows are visualization of data that run on the client side. The dashboards are created using Dashbuilder, which consumes data from any JSON source. You can define a dashboard in YAML format. To use the Dashbuilder, download and uncompress the dashbuilder-client NPM package. Also, edit the setup.js file to link your YAML files. For more information about using Dashbuilder, see Dashbuilder documentation. Figure 1. Dashbuilder You can build dashboards to monitor the data of your workflows using metrics. Prerequisites A workflow application is created. For more information about creating a workflow, see Creating your first workflow service. Procedure To enable metrics for your workflows application add org.kie:kie-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus dependency in pom.xml file of your application: Add metrics dependency to pom.xml file org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus You can find the metrics in /q/metrics path. The dashbuilder can consume the data of your workflow directly from the metrics endpoints. Therefore, you can use a JSONAta expression to format the metrics and display the metrics in a table using the following example of YAML code: Example YAML to show metrics in a table datasets: - uuid: swf_metrics url: http://localhost:8080/q/metrics expression: >- $map($, function($l) { [ $l[0], $contains($l[1], \"process_id\") ? $replace($match($l[1], /process_id=\".*?\"/).match, \"process_id\", \"workflow\") : $l[1], $l[2] = \"NaN\" ? -1 : $l[2] ] } ) pages: - components: - settings: lookup: uuid: swf_metrics Figure 2. Example metrics in a table To extract a specific information from your workflow, use specific metrics. Metrics related to workflows include: kogito_process_instance_completed_total: Completed workflows kogito_process_instance_started_total: Started workflows kogito_process_instance_running_total: Running workflows kogito_process_instance_duration_seconds_sum: Workflows total duration When you display the metrics, you can filter the data to include the specific metrics. You can use the metrics and bar chart components in dashbuilder to display the specific metrics and after filtering the metrics, you can put the information in bar charts as shown in the following example YAML code: Example YAML to display bar charts datasets: - uuid: metrics url: http://localhost:8080/q/metrics expression: >- $map($, function($l) { [ $l[0], $contains($l[1], \"process_id\") ? $replace($match($l[1], /process_id=\".*?\"/).match, \"process_id\", \"workflow\") : $l[1], $l[2] = \"NaN\" ? -1 : $l[2] ] } ) columns: - id: metric type: label - id: labels type: label - id: value type: number pages: - rows: - columns: - span: \"6\" components: - html: >- Started - settings: type: BARCHART chart: resizable: 'true' width: '2000' lookup: uuid: metrics sort: - column: value sortOrder: DESCENDING filter: - column: metric function: EQUALS_TO args: - \"kogito_process_instance_started_total\" group: - columnGroup: source: labels groupFunctions: - source: labels - source: value - span: \"6\" components: - html: >- Running - settings: type: BARCHART chart: resizable: 'true' width: '2000' lookup: uuid: metrics sort: - column: value sortOrder: DESCENDING filter: - column: metric function: EQUALS_TO args: - \"kogito_process_instance_running_total\" group: - columnGroup: source: labels groupFunctions: - source: labels - source: value - columns: - span: \"6\" components: - html: >- Completed - settings: type: BARCHART chart: resizable: 'true' width: '2000' dataSetLookup: uuid: metrics sort: - column: value sortOrder: DESCENDING filter: - column: metric function: EQUALS_TO args: - \"kogito_process_instance_completed_total\" group: - columnGroup: source: labels groupFunctions: - source: labels - source: value - span: \"6\" components: - html: >- Total Duration - settings: type: BARCHART chart: resizable: 'true' width: '2000' lookup: uuid: metrics sort: - column: value sortOrder: DESCENDING filter: - column: metric function: EQUALS_TO args: - \"kogito_process_instance_duration_seconds_sum\" group: - columnGroup: source: labels groupFunctions: - source: labels - source: value Figure 3. Example workflow metrics dashboard If you are using Prometheus, you can use PROMQL with Prometheus REST API and transform the result to JSON format that is supported by dashbuilder to build the dashoards. For more information about dashbuilder and Prometheus, see Creating Prometheus Dashboards using Dashbuilder. Data Index is a service that contains all the data related to the execution of your workflow. The Data Index service is available during the development mode. By default, you can access the Data Index at http://localhost:8180. The Data Index service uses GraphQL, so that dashbuilder can connect with the service using its REST API and transform the result to the supported format. Prerequisites A workflow application is created. For more information about creating a workflow, see Creating your first workflow service. Procedure Go to the Data Index GraphQL interface (default to http://localhost:8180/graphiql) and test your query. The following is an example of GraphQL query that lists all the workflows: Example GraphQL query to retrieve all workflows { ProcessInstances { processId processName state start end businessKey error {message} } } Run the GraphQL query. When you run the query, note that the URL is modified to includes the query. Copy the URL and modify graphiql to graphql. When you access the URL with graphql, it returns the result in a JSON format as shown in the following example: GraphQL JSON result when using the query { \"data\": { \"ProcessInstances\": [ { \"processId\": \"yamlgreet\", \"processName\": \"Greeting workflow\", \"state\": \"COMPLETED\", \"start\": \"2022-07-01T16:08:12.038Z\", \"end\": \"2022-07-01T16:08:12.061Z\", \"businessKey\": null, \"error\": null }, ] } } Internally, workflows are referenced as processes, therefore the processId is the workflow ID and processName is the workflow name. Transform the response to the transform expression. When you transform the response, note that the response includes the columns metdata for the data set. Example transform expression to retrieve fields from JSON response { \"columns\" :[ {\"id\": \"Workflow Id\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Workflow Name\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"State\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Start\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"End\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Business Key\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Error\", \"type\": \"label\"} ], \"values\" : $.data.ProcessInstances.[ processId, processName, state, start, end, businessKey ? businessKey : \"\", error ? error.message : \"\"] } Create your dashboard using the transform expression and the URL mentioned in the previous step. Example dashboard created using Data Index datasets: - uuid: workflows url: http://localhost:8180/graphql/?query=%7BProcessInstances%7BprocessId%20processName%20state%20start%20end%20businessKey%20error%7Bmessage%7D%7D%7D%0A expression: >- { \"columns\" :[ {\"id\": \"Workflow Id\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Workflow Name\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"State\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Start\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"End\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Business Key\", \"type\": \"label\"}, {\"id\": \"Error\", \"type\": \"label\"} ], \"values\" : $.data.ProcessInstances.[ processId, processName, state, start, end, businessKey ? businessKey : \"\", error ? error.message : \"\"] } pages: - components: - settings: type: BARCHART lookup: uuid: workflows group: - columnGroup: source: State functions: - source: State - source: State function: COUNT - settings: lookup: uuid: workflows The previous example of dashboard contains bar chart that counts the workflow instances by State and lists all the dashboards in a table. Following is the graphical dashboard resulted from the previous example: Figure 4. Example dashboard created using Data Index For more examples of dashboards, see Dashbuilder website.

Each extension is designed to work with a different communication alternative. For example, you can select if your workflows must interact with the Job Service by sending cloud events over the Knative eventing system or the kafka messaging system, or simply by executing direct REST calls. Finally, for the interaction work, you must configure your Quarkus Workflow Project with the extension of your choice. We recommend that you follow this procedure: Identify the communication alternative that best fits your scenario. Be sure that the Job Service is properly configured to support that alternative. This is very important if you want to use Knative events or kafka messages to communicate with it. Configure your Quarkus Workflow Project with the corresponding extension. If your workflows are not using timer-based actions, like timeouts, there is no need to add such an extension. To interact with the Job Service by sending cloud events over the Knative eventing system you must follow these steps: Be sure that you have read the Consuming and producing events on Knative Eventing guide, and that you have configured the project accordingly. Add the kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-knative-eventing extension to your Quarkus Workflow Project using any of the following alternatives: Manually Apache Maven Quarkus CLI org.kie kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-knative-eventing mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=\"kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-knative-eventing\" quarkus extension add kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-knative-eventing Add the following configurations to the application.properties file of your project. mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-job-service-job-request-events.connector=quarkus-http mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-job-service-job-request-events.url=${K_SINK:http://localhost:8280/v2/jobs/events} mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito-job-service-job-request-events.method=POST The K_SINK environment variable is automatically generated by the combination of the Knative ecosystem and the SinkBinding definition that will be automatically generated in the kogito.yml file. If this variable is not present, the default value http://localhost:8280/v2/jobs/events is used instead, this can be useful in development environments if you are executing the Job Service as a standalone service. Build your project and locate the automatically generated kogito.yml and knative.yml files in the /target/kubernetes directory of your project, see. mvn clean install Use the generated files to deploy your workflow application in the Kubernetes cluster using the following commands: kubectl apply -f target/kogito.yml kubectl apply -f target/knative.yml You can see a full example of this interaction mode configuration in the Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services example project.

This document describes the process of launching and testing the artifact that is produced by the Quarkus builds, and verifying the interaction of the artifact with a PostgreSQL database instance. To perform this scenario and verify the service behavior, the following Quarkus annotations and tools are used: @QuarkusIntegrationTest: This annotation is used to launch and test the artifact produced by the Serverless Workflow Quarkus build. For more information, see Testing Quarkus application - Using @QuarkusIntegrationTest in Quarkus documentation. Quarkus Dev Services: This facilitates writing integration tests that need launching services to support the workflow application.

For example, a pod restart, a programmed maintenance shutdown, etc. Every workflow instance requires some status information and data to execute, this information is automatically managed by the workflow’s runtime and is persisted at different moments of the workflow execution. For example, when a workflow instance reaches a state that needs to wait for an event, the engine takes a snapshot of the most relevant information, stores it in the database, and pauses that instance execution. In this way, resources like memory are released and can be used by other executing instances. This snapshot contains the workflow id, the instance id and version, the workflow data, and other relevant information required to resume that instance execution when the expected event arrives. When the persistence is not configured, an in-memory repository is used, making all this information volatile upon runtime restarts. And thus, if the workflow runtime is restarted while the workflow is waiting for the event, and the event arrives at a later point in time, that instance won’t be resumed. For non-testing or development environments, it’s strongly recommended to configure any of the available persistence mechanisms.

The persistence add-on uses Flyway to create the database schema. To enable the database schema creation during the runtime startup, you must set the following properties in the application.properties file. quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start=true quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql You can find more details regarding the PostgreSQL database schema migration in the Flyway migration guide. Optional: To handle the concurrent requests to shared workflow instances, enable the persistence-enabled optimistic locking for concurrency control using the version field in the database. Add kogito.persistence.optimistic.lock=true property in the application.properties file of your project to enable the optimistic locking. Change the version in the workflow file. Example workflow file { \"id\": \"applicantworkflow\", \"name\": \"Applicant Workflow\", \"version\": \"1.0\" } The versioning strategy is used to allow different workflow applications to run different versions of a process at the same time. The different versions of a process share the same database. This is useful when you migrate a process from one version to another. When allowing workflow instances to finish executing, a new version can be deployed using a new workflow application setup. By default, the engine considers the version specified in the workflow file as the current version of the asset. Therefore, you need to manually change the version in the workflow file, making the engine consider the specified version as a new version. As an alternative, you can set the kogito.workflow.version-strategy=project property in the application.properties file of your project. This enables the engine to consider the Maven or Gradle project version as the version of all workflows in the project. For instance, when you release a new version of your Maven project, the version in the workflow file is automatically updated. The following table serves as a quick reference of commonly used persistence configuration properties supported in SonataFlow. You can define these properties in the application.properties file of your project. Table 1.

When you upgrade your SonataFlow version, by default it won’t pick up the latest changes available. Kogito provides a mechanism for migrating your database while updating the Kogito version using the following Flyway properties (default value is false, not upgrade): quarkus.flyway.migrate-at-start=true quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql This will create a schema history table flyway_schema_history in your database to track the version of each database, recording in it every versioned migration file applied to build that version. When using kie-addons-persistence-jdbc, it is mandatory to set the quarkus.datasource.db-kind property, so that Flyway can locate the appropriate scripts for the database. If you want to migrate manually you can use the Flyway migration CLI tool. Download Flyway migration command-line tool from the Download Flyway Community Edition website. Add the following properties in the /conf/flyway.conf file: flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/foobardb flyway.user=foo flyway.password=bar You can specify these options with commands as well. The Flyway CLI will prompt for the username and password if they are missing in the configuration. $ flyway migrate -url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/foobardb -user=foo -password=bar Download the Kogito DDL zip from this link, choose the correct version, extract the files and use the scripts from the postgresql folder. You can specify the location of the SQL files that need to be migrated using the flyway.locations option. For example, flyway.locations=classpath:com.mycomp.migration,database/migrations,filesystem:/sql-migrations,s3:migrationsBucket,gcs:migrationsBucket You can use the provided SQL scripts in the zip file to migrate the database by executing them one by one. You can find the Kogito DDL scripts by visiting this link. Download the zip file of the scripts from the needed version for the Kogito upgrade. Extract the files. Execute the sql files from postgresql folder. > psql -H host -U username -d database_name -a -f create_table.sql In order to apply migrations to an existing schema. It is necessary to establish the baseline from where Flyway should start executing new migrations. That means, in case your schema already contains a structure and from now on, new changes provided by Kogito should be applied via Flyway integration. In Flyway terms, only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied. Using below properties you can initialize flyway schema table. quarkus.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true quarkus.flyway.baseline-version=1.32.0 $ flyway -baselineOnMigrate=\"true\" -baselineVersion=\"1.32.0\" migrate Be careful when enabling this feature as it removes the safety net which ensures that Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake.

Under the hood, it will discover the network endpoint (URL) to where to make the request. The Kubernetes service discovery feature works during the workflow application startup, in which this feature scans all the Quarkus configurations in search of the URI pattern. Therefore, you must remember that if the application startup time matters, consider using a known static URL instead. Following is the custom URI pattern in Kubernetes service discovery: URI pattern in Kubernetes service discovery kubernetes:..//?= \\________/ \\____/ \\_______/ \\_____/ \\_________/ \\____________/ \\______________________________/ scheme kind version group namespace resourceName additional resource attributes \\____________________/ \\__________________________/ GVK Supported values: - port-name={PORT_NAME} - labels=label-name=label-value;other-label=other-value The following scheme values are supported in the URI pattern: kubernetes openshift knative The following resources are supported for the Kubernetes GVK (Group, Version, and Kind): services.v1 services.v1.serving.knative.dev pods.v1 deployments.v1.apps deploymentconfigs.v1.apps.openshift.io statefulsets.v1.apps routes.v1.route.openshift.io ingresses.v1.networking.k8s.io When using knative, you can also use a simplified URI like: knative:/ The above URI looks directly for services.v1.serving.knative.dev resource. The namespace in the URI is optional, however, if namespace contains an empty value, the current namespace or context is used. Query parameters in URI Also known as query string. The query parameters are defined the similar way with URLs to assign value to specific attributes. The following query parameters help the engine to be more precise when querying for a given Kubernetes resource: Custom labels: The custom labels are used to filter services in case there are more than one service with the same label selector but exposing different ports. In this case, you can instruct the engine that if more than one service is found, then the engine must use the service containing the provided label. The label is defined with the following expression and in case of multiple labels, you can use semicolon (;): labels=label-name=namevalue;another-label=another-value Example label definition in URI kubernetes:pods.v1//?labels=label-name=test-label Using the previous URI example, if there are more than one service exposing the given pod, the label-name=test-label label is used to filter the service. If the label does not exist, the first found service is used. Custom port name: The custom port name is used to determine which port to use when multiple ports are configured in the target service or container. You can configure the port name to be queried using the following pattern: port-name= The service discovery engine requires that the Kubernetes Service Account running the application has read permissions for the discovered objects. The following Kubernetes Role resource has all the required permissions for the service discovery to work: Required permissions for the Service Discovery on Kubernetes apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: Role metadata: name: service-discovery-role rules: - apiGroups: - \"\" resources: - pods - services verbs: - get - list - apiGroups: - apps resources: - deployments - statefulsets verbs: - get - list - apiGroups: - networking.k8s.io resources: - ingresses verbs: - get - list # Knative - apiGroups: - serving.knative.dev resources: - services verbs: - get - list If running on OpenShift, you must also add the following rules: Additional rules to run on OpenShift rules: - apiGroups: - route.openshift.io resources: - routes verbs: - get - list - apiGroups: - apps.openshift.io resources: - deploymentconfigs verbs: - get - list You must then bind the Service Account with the Role via a RoleBinding: RoleBinding for the required service discovery role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: service-discovery-rolebinding roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: service-discovery-role subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: default Usually, pods run using the default Service Account. If your cluster has a different configuration, you should adapt this RoleBinding to your requirements. You must create these two objects in every namespace that you wish to deploy Quarkus Workflow applications with Service Discovery enabled. As an alternative, you can create a ClusterRole instead of a Role in every namespace. In this case, the role will reflect globally in your cluster. For security reasons, you should avoid this approach. There is no specific configuration required for the Kubernetes service discovery except by using the expected URI pattern. However, the okhttp communication interceptor, which logs the communication between the application and the Kubernetes API is disabled by default. You can enable the okhttp communication interceptor if there is a need to debug the communication between the client and the Kubernetes API by setting the following application property: Application property to enable okhttp communication interceptor quarkus.log.category.\"okhttp3.OkHttpClient\".level=INFO Based on the resource to be discovered, the Kubernetes service discovery follows specific paths as shown in the following figure: The Kubernetes service discovery is performed at the STATIC_INIT time of Quarkus during the workflow application startup. First, the service discovery scans the Quarkus configuration values and searches for the Kubernetes URI pattern. If the URI pattern is found, the engine parses the URI, queries the Kubernetes API searching for the given resource, and overrides the given application property. For example, consider an application that consumes a resource running on Kubernetes. This resource is a Knative service that exposes a function, which can be discovered using the following URI: Example URI org.kie.kogito.sw.knative.service=${knative:services.v1/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus/greeting-quarkus-cli} Or you can reference a specific endpoint of the Knative service using the following URI: Example endpoint URI org.kie.kogito.sw.knative.service=${knative:services.v1/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus/greeting-quarkus-cli}/endpoint The service discovery engine does not read the application property name, but only value. Once the workflow application is started, you can see the Kubernetes service discovery into action in the logs: Example logs $ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar __ ____ __ _____ ___ __ ____ ______ --/ __ \\/ / / / _ | / _ \\/ //_/ / / / __/ -/ /_/ / /_/ / __ |/ , _/ , org.kie kie-addons-quarkus-kubernetes org.kie kogito-addons-quarkus-fabric8-kubernetes-service-catalog This implementation retrieves information from the application’s configuration, making it valuable in scenarios where users rely on the operator to provide the necessary information from the hosting platform.

The testing procedure described in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-stock-profit example application in GitHub repository. The serverless-workflow-stock-profit example application is a workflow that computes the profit for a given stock based on an existing stock portfolio. The serverless-workflow-stock-profit example application sends request to the following services: stock-portfolio-service: Calculates the stock portfolio profit for a given stock based on the current stock price. stock-service: Retrieves the current stock price. Developing an application using a service that returns different results every time can be difficult, therefore the stock-service uses the following implementations depending on the environment. real-stock-service (default implementation): Returns the real stock price. This service returns a random price every time to simulate a real stock service. This implementation is used in normal or production environment. fake-stock-service: Returns the same price every time. This implementation is used in the development environment. The stock-profit service contains the following workflow definition: Workflow definition in stock-profit service { \"id\": \"stockprofit\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"version\": \"2.0.0-SNAPSHOT\", \"name\": \"Stock profit Workflow\", \"start\": \"GetStockPrice\", \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"getStockPriceFunction\", \"operation\": \"openapi/stock-svc.yaml#getStockPrice\" (1) }, { \"name\": \"getProfitFunction\", \"operation\": \"openapi/stock-portfolio-svc.yaml#getStockProfit\" (2) } ], \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"GetStockPrice\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actionMode\": \"sequential\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"getStockPrice\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"getStockPriceFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"symbol\": \".symbol\" } } } ], \"transition\": \"ComputeProfit\" }, { \"name\": \"ComputeProfit\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actionMode\": \"sequential\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"getStockProfit\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"getProfitFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"symbol\": \".symbol\", \"currentPrice\": \".currentPrice\" } } } ], \"end\": true } ] } 1 Defines the stock-service service operation 2 Defines the stock-portfolio-service service operation SonataFlow leverages Quarkus profiles to configure the workflow application depending on the target environment. To set properties for different profiles, each property needs to be prefixed with a percentage (%) followed by the profile name and a period (.) in the syntax as %.config.name. By default, Quarkus provides the following profiles that activate automatically in certain conditions: dev: Activates in development mode, such as quarkus:dev test: Activates when tests are running preview (default profile): Activates when not running in development or test mode You can also create additional profiles and activate them using the quarkus.profile configuration property. For more information about Quarkus profiles, see Profiles in the Quarkus Configuration reference guide. You can define the URLs of the services in different environments by using profiles. Procedure Create a file named application.properties in the src/main/resources directory of the workflow project, if the file does not exist. In the application.properties file, add the OpenAPI configuration for the default environment: Example properties in application.properties file quarkus.rest-client.stock_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8383/ (1) quarkus.rest-client.stock_portfolio_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8282/ 1 URL of the real-stock-service service In the application.properties file, add the OpenAPI configuration for the dev environment: Example properties for development environment %dev.quarkus.rest-client.stock_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8181/ (1) 1 URL of the fake-stock-service service The %dev. prefix indicates the dev profile configuration, which is used when you run mvn quarkus:dev or quarkus dev. After defining the URLs of the services, you can run the services that the workflow sends request to. Prerequisites URLs of the services in the different environments are defined. For more information, see Defining the URLs of the services in different environments. Procedure In a separate command terminal window, run the stock-portfolio-service service: Run the stock-portfolio-service service cd stock-portfolio-service mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=false You can access the stock-portfolio-service service at http://localhost:8282/. In a separate command terminal window, run the real-stock-service service: Run real-stock-service service cd real-stock-service mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=false You can access the real-stock-service service at http://localhost:8383/. In a separate command terminal window, run the fake-stock-service service: Run fake-stock-service service cd fake-stock-service mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=false You can access the fake-stock-service service at http://localhost:8181/. When you define %dev.quarkus.rest-client.stock_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8181/, the fake-stock-service service is used in the development mode and you get the same result every time you run the workflow. Using this example, you can run the workflow application in development mode. Prerequisites Services that the workflow application sends requests to are started. For more information, see Running the services. Procedure In a separate command terminal window, run the workflow application in development mode: Run workflow application in development mode cd stock-profit mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=false In a separate command terminal window, send a request to the workflow application: Example request curl -X 'POST' \\ 'http://localhost:8080/stockprofit' \\ -H 'accept: */*' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"symbol\": \"KGTO\" }' Example response {\"id\":\"5ab5dcb8-5952-4730-b526-cace363774bb\",\"workflowdata\":{\"symbol\":\"KGTO\",\"currentPrice\":75,\"profit\":\"50%\"}} Note that, in the previous example fake-stock-service is used, therefore, the computed profit property is same no matter how many times you run the workflow. When you define quarkus.rest-client.stock_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8383/, the real-stock-service service is used in the normal or production mode and you get different results every time you run the workflow. Using this example, you can run the workflow application in normal or production mode. Prerequisites Services that the workflow application sends requests to are started.

You can define the URLs of the services in different environments using profiles and environment variables. Prerequisites Services that the workflow application sends requests to are started. For more information, see Running the services. Procedure In a separate command terminal window, run the workflow application in development mode, overwriting the property defined in the application.properties file using an environment variable: Run the workflow application in development mode cd stock-profit export _DEV_QUARKUS_REST_CLIENT_STOCK_SVC_YAML_URL=http://localhost:8383/ (1) mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=false 1 Overwrite the %dev.quarkus.rest-client.stock_svc_yaml.url=http://localhost:8181/ defined in the application.properties file using an environment variable, which is pointing to real-stock-service.

This document describes how to create a workflow that invokes a running gRPC service and how to configure properties to locate that running gRPC service. For information about gRPC concepts, see gRPC. In order to illustrate how gRPC integration works, this Serverless Workflow application is used. This example greets a user in their preferred language by invoking a gRPC service. Relevant files of the workflow application include: gRPC proto file: This file defines a greeter service, which consists of sayHello methods, each covering a different gRPC scenario: The sayHello method accepts two parameters, including name of the user and an optional language to use in the greeting message (English by default). The sayHello method returns the greeting message in the appropriate language. The SayHelloAllLanguages accepts just the name parameter and streams greetings in all languages supported by the service. This represents the server-side streaming scenario. The SayHelloMultipleLanguagesAtOnce accepts a stream of name-language pairs as parameters and returns corresponding greetings as one block of text after the streaming is finished. This is the client-side streaming scenario. The SayHelloMultipleLanguages accepts a stream of name-language pairs and streams back greetings with a respective name and in a respective language. // The greeter service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} rpc SayHelloAllLanguages (HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply) {} rpc SayHelloMultipleLanguagesAtOnce (stream HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} rpc SayHelloMultipleLanguages (stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloReply) {} ... } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; string language=2; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } Workflow definition file: This file defines an RPC function. \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"sayHello\", \"type\": \"rpc\", \"operation\": \"greeting.proto#Greeter#SayHello\" } ] In this rpc function, the operation property is composed of three tokens separated by #. The three tokens include: URI of the proto file (greeting.proto) Name of the service (Greeter) Name of the method (SayHello) SonataFlow supports three URI schemes, including http, file, and classpath (default). Therefore, in the previous example, the greeting.proto is expected to be found in the project classpath. The execution of the workflow consists of a single operation state, which is composed of one action. { \"name\": \"sayHello\", \"functionRef\" : { \"refName\": \"sayHello\", \"arguments\": { \"name\": \".name\", \"language\": \".language\" } } } In the previous example, the action invokes the sayHello RPC method using two model variables: name and language. These parameters are provided as part of the REST call that starts the workflow. The response of the method execution is mapped to a JSON object and merged with the workflow model. For the remaining scenarios, see the following workflow definition files: Server streaming Client streaming Bidirectional streaming The only difference to the basic scenario is that workflows with client streaming expect an array of requests as arguments of the gRPC function: { \"name\": \"SayHelloMultipleLanguagesAtOnce\", \"functionRef\" : { \"refName\": \"SayHelloMultipleLanguagesAtOnce\", \"arguments\": \".helloRequests\" } } The function expects an array of requests which is mapped under the helloRequests key in the workflow model. In case of server streaming, the response is returned as an array as well and merged with the workflow model. In these examples, because no stateDataFilter is defined, the response is merged under the default response key in the workflow model. Maven POM: The gRPC functionality is included within workflow dependencies, which means you do not need to add specific dependencies for gRPC to work with SonataFlow. This pom.xml file contains the following resource node: ${project.basedir}/../serverless-workflow-greeting-server-rpc-quarkus/src/main/proto greeting.proto The reason for this snippet to exist is to guarantee that the proto file is included in the classpath. Remember that in the workflow file, the URI for the proto file does not contain any scheme, therefore the proto file is expected to be accessible in the classpath. The previous, Maven based, approach can be used when the source code of the workflow and the gRPC server are stored in the same repository, but normally this will not be the case. If the proto file can be downloaded from a remote server, you might use the http scheme. If the proto file is not remotely accessible, you will need to manually obtain a copy of it and store in a directory that is included in the classpath (for example src/main/resources). Another possibility is to copy the proto file in a well known absolute path (that might be a shared network file system) and use the file scheme. Application properties: In the application.properties file, you can add the information for the workflow application to locate the gRPC server. Internally, the workflow implementation uses the same set of properties as Quarkus gRPC client. The client-name used by SonataFlow is the service name declared in the proto file. Therefore, since in this example a service called Greeter is invoked, the following code is added to the properties. quarkus.grpc.clients.Greeter.host=localhost quarkus.grpc.clients.Greeter.port=50051 In the same GitHub repository as the example application, there is a Maven project which provides a simple implementation of the Greeter service. By default, this gRPC server runs on port 50051. Therefore, the same port is used in the application.properties file. gRPC specification requires enumeration types to have a default value. The default value is not included in the server response payload. Therefore, use an empty value such as UNKNOWN as default. If, for any reason, your default value is semantically valid and you want the value to be included in the workflow model, you must set kogito.grpc.enum.includeDefault property to true. This way enumeration fields are always filled by the workflow if the server response does not include them. Before running the workflow application, you need to start the gRPC server the workflow invokes. To run the gRPC server, navigate to the serverless-workflow-greeting-server-rpc-quarkus directory in a command terminal and enter the command: mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.kie.kogito.examples.sw.greeting.GreeterService\" Once the server is running, you must navigate to the serverless-workflow-greeting-client-rpc-quarkus directory in a separate command terminal and run the workflow application by entering the following command: mvn clean quarkus:dev Once the workflow application is started, you can invoke the workflow instance using any HTTP client, such as curl, from a separate command terminal.

The example described in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-order-processing example application. The workflow application that you want to test must be configured to use Knative Eventing. You must configure Knative Eventing using standard HTTP POST requests to send and receive events between event producers and sinks. The events between the event producers and sinks follow the CloudEvents specification, which enables creating, parsing, sending, and receiving events in any programming language. When you create an event source, you can specify a sink where events are sent to, from the source. A sink is a transferable or a callable resource that can receive incoming events from other resources. The examples of sink include Kubernetes deployments, Knative services, channels, and brokers. This document describes the testing of Knative service that is configured as a sink, and the same Knative service is mocked to verify if the CloudEvents are received correctly by the sink. In this process, the WireMock framework adds the mocked server, verifying the CloudEvents received by the sink during the workflow service execution. You can test a workflow application using SinkBinding. Prerequisites Your workflow application is working. For more information about creating a workflow application, see Creating your first workflow service. Your workflow application is configured to use HTTP CloudEvents using SinkBinding. For more information about enabling event-driven architecture in your workflow application using Knative Eventing, see Consuming and producing events on Knative Eventing. Procedure Add the required test dependencies to the pom.xml file of your workflow application: Add test dependencies to pom.xml file io.quarkus quarkus-junit5 (1) test io.rest-assured rest-assured (1) test com.github.tomakehurst wiremock-jre8 (2) test org.awaitility awaitility (3) test 1 quarkus-junit5 and rest-assured dependencies are required for HTTP-based testing in JVM mode. 2 wiremock-jre8 dependency allows you to mock the server that acts as a sink. 3 awaitility dependency is used to express the expectations of an asynchronous system. For more information, see Awaitility website. You can also see the dependencies added in pom.xml file of serverless-workflow-order-processing example application. Add failsafe maven plug-in to run integration tests: maven-failsafe-plugin in the pom.xml plug-in section maven-failsafe-plugin ${version.failsafe.plugin} org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager ${maven.home} integration-test verify More information in maven-failsafe-plugin documentation. Create a test class that mocks the sink using WireMock as shown in the following example: Example of a test class @QuarkusTest(1) public class VerifyWorkflowExecutionIT { (2) private static WireMockServer sink; (3) static { (4) RestAssured.enableLoggingOfRequestAndResponseIfValidationFails(); } /** * Starts the \"sink\" server, which is the endpoint that will receive our produced events */ @BeforeAll (5) public static void startSink() { sink = new WireMockServer(options().port(8181)); (6) sink.start(); (7) sink.stubFor(post(\"/\").willReturn(aResponse().withBody(\"ok\").withStatus(200))); (8) } @AfterAll (9) public static void stopSink() { if (sink != null) { sink.stop(); (10) } } @Test void processDomesticOrderUnderFraudEval() throws JsonProcessingException, InterruptedException { final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); final Order order = new Order(); order.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString()); order.setDescription(\"iPhone 12\"); order.setTotal(1001); order.setCountry(\"US\"); given() (4) .header(\"ce-specversion\", \"1.0\") .header(\"ce-id\", order.getId()) .header(\"ce-source\", \"/from/test\") .header(\"ce-type\", \"orderEvent\") .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) .body(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(order)) .post(\"/\") .then() .statusCode(200); await() (11) .atMost(60, SECONDS) .with().pollInterval(1, SECONDS) .untilAsserted(() -> { sink.verify(2, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(order.getId()))); sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(\"\\\"type\\\":\\\"fraudEvaluation\\\"\").and(containing(\"\\\"id\\\":\\\"\" + order.getId() + \"\\\"\")))); sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(\"\\\"type\\\":\\\"domesticShipping\\\"\").and(containing(\"\\\"id\\\":\\\"\" + order.getId() + \"\\\"\")))); }); (12) } } 1 @QuarkusTest starts the Quarkus server for the lifetime of the test execution run. For more information, see Quarkus - Testing your application. 2 The test name ends with IT to identify which test needs to be executed as an integration test. More details in maven-failsafe-plugin documentation. 3 WireMockServer is a mocked server instance that is used for SinkBinding for testing. 4 given() is used to test interactions with the application. For more information about testing interactions, see Testing your workflow application using REST Assured. 5 @BeforeAll annotation is used to signal that the annotated method must be executed before running all the tests. 6 Creates a WireMockServer instance, listening at the port that is passed as a parameter and must match with the sink configuration. 7 Starts the server before the tests are executed. 8 Stubs the mocked API response. It accepts a MappingBuilder instance that is used to build API mapping information, such as URL, request parameters, body, headers, and authorization. 9 @AfterAll annotation is used to signal that the annotated method must be executed after executing all the tests. 10 Stops the server after executing all the tests. 11 await() is added to wait for asynchronous operations. 12 verify verifies if the request hits the mock API using the expected event content. You can check the VerifyWorkflowExecutionIT class of serverless-workflow-order-processing example application. Start the server before executing the tests, and stop the server once the tests are completed. You can also reset the mock stubs between the tests. Configure your test application to use the WireMockServer as a sink. Also, add the reference of WireMockServer in the application.properties file as shown in the following example: Example adding sink connection property in application.properties file mp.messaging.outgoing.kogito_outgoing_stream.url=http://0.0.0.0:8181 (1) 1 The port that needs to match with the passed parameter. The parameter is passed when the WireMockServer is created in the test class. For more information, see application.properties file of serverless-workflow-order-processing example application. To run the tests, execute the following command: Run the tests mvn clean verify The testing example in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-order-processing example application. The serverless-workflow-order-processing example application contains three workflows as shown in the following figure: Figure 1. Workflows in serverless-workflow-order-processing example The Order Workflow in the serverless-workflow-order-processing example application processes the incoming order event and starts a parallel state, which sends requests to two workflows including Fraud Handling and Shipping Handling. The Order Workflow ends when both Fraud Handling and Shipping Handling workflows are completed. The Fraud Handling workflow produces a FraudEvaluation event if the received order is more than 1000 USD. In the workflow architecture, any other system or service can read the FraudEvaluation event and react upon it, such as canceling the order. Simultaneously, regardless of evaluating the fraud, the Shipping Handling workflow produces events that classify the required shipping service, such as international or domestic. In this example, domestic shipping is classified for any order, containing the address within the United States. The following figure shows the event flow among the components in the serverless-workflow-order-processing example application: Figure 2. Example of event flow among components Also, the testing components replicate the interactions to verify the events that are received by the sink as shown in the following figure: Figure 3. Example of testing events flow Before executing a test, the WireMockServer starts listening to the configured port as the sink. The sink listens to the events that are produced by the workflows. When a workflow produces an event to the sink, the produced event is received by the WireMockServer, and then the test verifies the event content. The processDomesticOrderUnderFraudEval in the VerifyWorkflowExecutionIT class, produces events, such as fraudEvaluation (Total > 1000) and domesticShipping (country = \"US\"). Also, the order event consumed by the Order Workflow needs to match the requirements as shown in the following example: Example requirements for Order Workflow final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); final Order order = new Order(); order.setId(UUID.randomUUID().toString()); order.setDescription(\"iPhone 12\"); order.setTotal(1001); order.setCountry(\"US\"); given() .header(\"ce-specversion\", \"1.0\") .header(\"ce-id\", order.getId()) .header(\"ce-source\", \"/from/test\") .header(\"ce-type\", \"orderEvent\") .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) .body(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(order)) .post(\"/\") .then() .statusCode(200); After matching the requirements, the test verifies if the sink is receiving the expected events as shown in the following example: Example of a sink verification await() .atMost(60, SECONDS) .with().pollInterval(1, SECONDS) .untilAsserted(() -> { sink.verify(2, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(order.getId()))); sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(\"\\\"type\\\":\\\"fraudEvaluation\\\"\").and(containing(\"\\\"id\\\":\\\"\" + order.getId() + \"\\\"\")))); sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(\"\\\"type\\\":\\\"domesticShipping\\\"\").and(containing(\"\\\"id\\\":\\\"\" + order.getId() + \"\\\"\")))); }); The await() method in the previous example allows the test to retry the validations until the verifications are declared or until the specified time is expired. In this example, the specified time is 60 seconds. The following example shows how to check if the sink (WireMockServer) receives two events for the same order ID: Example if sink receives the events sink.verify(2, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(order.getId()))); To check the content of the received events, the following verifications can be declared or performed on the types: Example of verifications sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(\"\\\"type\\\":\\\"fraudEvaluation\\\"\").and(containing(\"\\\"id\\\":\\\"\" + order.getId() + \"\\\"\")))); sink.verify(1, postRequestedFor(urlEqualTo(\"/\")).withRequestBody(containing(\"\\\"type\\\":\\\"domesticShipping\\\"\").and(containing(\"\\\"id\\\":\\\"\" + order.getId() + \"\\\"\")))); After declaring the verifications on received events, the test successfully ends and the WireMockServer stops.

The testing procedure described in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-service-calls-quarkus example application. WireMock is an open source Mocking API for unit, integration, and performance tests. You can use WireMock to isolate your tests from third party APIs and prototype APIs that do not exist. Prerequisites The examples used in this document assumes that you have the following prerequisites: Required tooling is installed. For more information, see Getting familiar with SonataFlow tooling. A workflow project is created and orchestrates OpenAPI services. For more information about orchestrating OpenAPI services, see Orchestrating the OpenAPI services. The procedure in this section describes how you can add WireMock to your workflow application. Prerequisites A quarkus workflow project is created. For more information about creating a workflow project, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow Java service. Procedure Add the following WireMock dependency to the pom.xml file of your project: Add WireMock dependency to pom.xml com.github.tomakehurst wiremock-jre8 {wiremock.version} test Replace {wiremock.version} variable with the version of WireMock that you want to use. Select one of the following methods to start your WireMock server: You can start the WireMock server as a QuarkusTestResource. If you select this method, then the WireMock server is started once before you run any test, and the server is stopped when the test finishes. This option is suitable for most use cases. You can start the WireMock server independently for each test. This option is useful when you want each test to behave differently. For more information about starting the WireMock server, see Starting WireMock server as a QuarkusTestResource and Starting WireMock server for a specific test. Start the WireMock server as shown in the following example: Example of starting a WireMock server WireMockConfiguration config = WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig().dynamicPort(); (1) WireMockServer wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(config); (2) wireMockServer.start(); (3) 1 Creates the configuration for the WireMock server. You can use a dynamic port since it prevents the tests from failing due to port conflicts. When you cannot use a dynamic port, you can use the WireMockConfiguration#port(int) method to use a fixed port number. 2 Creates the WireMock server instance. 3 Starts the WireMock server. Mock the endpoints as shown in the following example: Example of mocking endpoints ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); JsonNode greecePayload = objectMapper.readTree(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/country_mock.json\")); (1) wireMockServer.stubFor(WireMock.get(WireMock.urlEqualTo(\"/rest/v2/name/Greece\")) (2) .willReturn(WireMock.aResponse() (3) .withStatus(200) (4) .withHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\") (5) .withJsonBody(greecePayload))); (6) 1 Creates the JSON payload, which the WireMock server returns. Alternatively, you can use the ResponseDefinitionBuilder#withBody method to define a String or a byte[] as the response body. 2 Defines a stub for the /rest/v2/name/Greece endpoint. 3 Defines the response for the stub. 4 Defines the response status. 5 Defines the response headers. 6 Defines the response body. Stop the WireMock server as shown in the following example: Example of stopping a WireMock server wireMockServer.stop(); In the process of adding a mocked OpenAPI service to your tests, you need to start the WireMock server. You can start the WireMock server either as a QuarkusTestResource or you can start the server for each test. The procedure in this section describes how you can start the WireMock server as a QuarkusTestResource. For more information about QuarkusTestResource, see Starting services before the Quarkus application starts document. Prerequisites A quarkus workflow project is created. For more information about creating a workflow project, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow Java service. WireMock dependency is added in the pom.xml file. Procedure Create a class that implements the QuarkusTestResource interface as shown in the following example: Example implementation of QuarkusTestResource import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper; import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.WireMockServer; import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.core.WireMockConfiguration; import io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.UncheckedIOException; import java.util.Map; import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock.aResponse; import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock.get; import static com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock.urlEqualTo; public class RestCountriesMockServer implements QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager { private WireMockServer wireMockServer; @Override public Map start() { (1) configureWiremockServer(); return Map.of(\"quarkus.rest-client.restcountries_json.url\", wireMockServer.baseUrl() + \"/rest\"); (2) } private void configureWiremockServer() { wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig().dynamicPort()); wireMockServer.start(); ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); JsonNode greecePayload; try { greecePayload = objectMapper.readTree(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/country_mock.json\")); } catch (IOException e) { throw new UncheckedIOException(e); } wireMockServer.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo(\"/rest/v2/name/Greece\")) .willReturn(aResponse() .withStatus(200) .withHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\") .withJsonBody(greecePayload))); } @Override public void stop() { (3) if (wireMockServer != null) { wireMockServer.stop(); } } } 1 Starts the test resource. This method is called once before running all the tests. 2 Returns a map of application properties that are set in the test environment. In this case, the quarkus.rest-client.restcountries_json.url property is set as the base URL of the WireMock server. 3 Stops the test resource. This method is called once after running all the tests. Use the QuarkusTestResource implementation in your test class as shown in the following example: Example of a test class using the QuarkusTestResource implementation import io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResource; import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; @QuarkusTest @QuarkusTestResource(RestCountriesMockServer.class) (1) class CountryServiceWorkflowTest { @Test void testFeatureA() { // ... } @Test void testFeatureB() { // ... } } 1 Uses the RestCountriesMockServer class as a test resource. You can also start the WireMock server to be used in a specific test. Prerequisites A quarkus workflow project is created. For more information about creating a workflow project, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow Java service. WireMock dependency is added in the pom.xml file.

While all the scenarios contain the same set of workflows, they are provided as independent example projects, to facilitate the execution and understanding of each case. The following workflows are provided: workflow_timeouts callback_state_timeouts switch_state_timeouts event_state_timeouts It is a simple workflow that, rather than configuring a timeout for a particular state, is configured for the whole execution of the workflow. This can be done by using the workflowExecTimeout property, which defines the maximum workflow execution time. If this time is surpassed and the workflow has not finished, it will be automatically canceled. See the workflow timeout definition for more information. Figure 1. workflow_timeouts workflow Workflow execution timeout definition { \"id\": \"workflow_timeouts\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"name\": \"Workflow Timeouts\", \"description\": \"Simple workflow to show the workflowExecTimeout working\", \"start\": \"PrintStartMessage\", \"timeouts\": { \"workflowExecTimeout\": \"PT1H\" } ... } It is a simple workflow that, when the execution reaches the state CallbackState, an action is executed, and it waits for the event callbackEvent to arrive in order to continue the execution. However, a timeout is configured to set the maximum waiting time for that event. Figure 2. callback_state_timeouts workflow Callback event definition { \"name\": \"callbackEvent\", \"source\": \"\", \"type\": \"callback_event_type\" } CallbackState definition { \"name\": \"CallbackState\", \"type\": \"callback\", \"action\": { \"name\": \"callbackAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"callbackFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"input\": \"${\\\"callback-state-timeouts: \\\" + $WORKFLOW.instanceId + \\\" has executed the callbackFunction.\\\"}\" } } }, \"eventRef\": \"callbackEvent\", \"transition\": \"CheckEventArrival\", \"onErrors\": [ { \"errorRef\": \"callbackError\", \"transition\": \"FinalizeWithError\" } ], \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT30S\" } } The timeout is configured with a duration of 30 seconds, and if no event arrives during this time, the flow execution moves to the next state, and the workflow’s data remains unchanged. On the other hand, if the event arrive, the event payload is merged into the workflow’s data, and thus, the eventData property of the workflow’s data, will contain the information carried by the event payload. Using this simple configuration strategy, the workflow can collect the event information, and use it for example to determine the path to go in the next state. See the callback state definition for more information. For more information about how the incoming event information can be merged into the workflow’s data you can see Event data filters. This workflow is similar to the callback_state_timeouts, but when the execution reaches the state ChooseOneEvent, it waits for one of the two configured events, visaDeniedEvent or visaApprovedEvent to arrive. If any of the configured events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow execution moves to the next state defined in the corresponding transition. If none of the events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow execution moves to the state defined in the defaultCondition transition. See the switch state definition for more information. Figure 3. switch_state_timeouts workflow ChooseOneEvent definition { \"name\": \"ChooseOnEvent\", \"type\": \"switch\", \"eventConditions\": [ { \"eventRef\": \"visaApprovedEvent\", \"transition\": \"ApprovedVisa\" }, { \"eventRef\": \"visaDeniedEvent\", \"transition\": \"DeniedVisa\" } ], \"defaultCondition\": { \"transition\": \"HandleNoVisaDecision\" }, \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT30S\" } } This workflow is similar to the switch_state_timeouts, but when the execution reaches the state WaitForEvent, it waits for one of the configured events, event1 or event2, to arrive. Each event has a number of configured actions to execute, but unlike the switch state, only one possible transition exists. If none of the configured events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow execution moves to the next state defined in the transition property, skipping the events that were not received in time together with actions configured for them. If one of the events arrives before the timeout is overdue, the workflow executes the corresponding actions, and finally moves to the state defined in transition. The semantic of this state might vary depending on the exclusive flag, in the example the default value of true will be applied, and thus, the workflow will transition as soon as the first event arrives. See the event state definition for more information. Figure 4. event_state_timeouts workflow WaitForEvent definition { \"name\": \"WaitForEvent\", \"type\": \"event\", \"onEvents\": [ { \"eventRefs\": [ \"event1\" ], \"eventDataFilter\": { \"data\": \"${ \\\"The event1 was received.\\\" }\", \"toStateData\": \"${ .exitMessage }\" }, \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAfterEvent1\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"systemOut\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"${\\\"event-state-timeouts: \\\" + $WORKFLOW.instanceId + \\\" executing actions for event1.\\\"}\" } } } ] }, { \"eventRefs\": [ \"event2\" ], \"eventDataFilter\": { \"data\": \"${ \\\"The event2 was received.\\\" }\", \"toStateData\": \"${ .exitMessage }\" }, \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAfterEvent2\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"systemOut\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"${\\\"event-state-timeouts: \\\" + $WORKFLOW.instanceId + \\\" executing actions for event2.\\\"}\" } } } ] } ], \"timeouts\": { \"eventTimeout\": \"PT30S\" }, \"transition\": \"PrintExitMessage\" } To execute the workflows you can use any of the available deployment scenarios: SonataFlow Operator Dev Profile Quarkus Workflow Project with embedded services Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services When you work with the SonataFlow Operator Dev Profile, the operator will automatically provision an execution environment that contains an embedded job service instance, as well as an instance of the data index service. And thus, there is no need for additional configurations when you use timeouts. To execute the workflows you must: In a command terminal, clone the incubator-kie-kogito-examples repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow these steps: git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples.git cd incubator-kie-kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-operator-devprofile Similar to the SonataFlow Operator Dev Profile, this scenario shows how to configure the embedded job service and data index service, when you work with a Quarkus Workflow project and it is also intended for development purposes. In a command terminal, clone the incubator-kie-kogito-examples repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow these steps: git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples.git cd incubator-kie-kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-embedded This is the most complex and close to a production scenario. In this case, the workflows, the job service, the data index service, and the database are deployed as standalone services in the kubernetes or Knative cluster. Additionally, the communications from the workflows to the job service, and from the job service to the data index service, are resolved via the Knative eventing system. By using the Knative eventing system the underlying low level communication system is transparent to the integration. The following diagram shows the architecture for this use case: Every time a workflow needs to program a timer for a given timeout, a cloud event is sent to the job service for that purpose. When a timer is overdue, a rest call is executed to notify the workflow, which then must execute accordingly to the given state semantic. Workflow and job status changes are propagated to the data index service via cloud events. Figure 5. Knative Workflow with Job Service architecture timeouts-showcase-extended: Is the Quarkus Workflow Project that contains the workflows, that must be maven build, and deployed into the kubernetes cluster. jobs-service-postresql: Is the job service that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster. data-index-service-postgresql: Is the data index service that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster. timeouts-showcase-database: Is the PostgreSQL instance that will be deployed into the kubernetes cluster. For simplification purposes, a single database instance is used for both services to store the information about the workflow instances, and the timers. However, in a production environment is recommended to have independent database instances. To execute the workflows you must: In a command terminal, clone the incubator-kie-kogito-examples repository, navigate to the cloned directory, and follow these steps: git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples.git cd incubator-kie-kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-timeouts-showcase-extended Timeouts support in SonataFlow If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.
