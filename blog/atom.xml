        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <strong>Apache KIE (Incubating) 10.1.0</strong>, the first follow-up milestone since the project's rebirth under the Apache Software Foundation. This release reflects the project's continued momentum and commitment to modernization, usability, and stability across the KIE components: Drools, jBPM, OptaPlanner, Kogito, SonataFlow and Tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="laying-groundwork-for-the-future">Laying Groundwork for the Future<a href="https://kie.apache.org/blog/kie_10_1_0_release#laying-groundwork-for-the-future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laying Groundwork for the Future" title="Direct link to Laying Groundwork for the Future">​</a></h2>
<p>Following the foundational work in 10.0.0, this release introduces key upgrades and deprecations, improves compatibility, and continues efforts to simplify the developer and authoring experience. While not as sweeping as the prior release, 10.1.0 brings meaningful enhancements across the stack.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="platform-upgrades">Platform Upgrades<a href="https://kie.apache.org/blog/kie_10_1_0_release#platform-upgrades" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Platform Upgrades" title="Direct link to Platform Upgrades">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Quarkus upgraded to version <code>3.15.3.1</code> (from 3.8.4)</li>
<li>Spring Boot upgraded to version <code>3.4.3</code> (from 3.2.6)</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates align with our goal of keeping KIE technologies up-to-date with modern Java ecosystems.</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advancing-rule-units">Advancing Rule Units<a href="https://kie.apache.org/blog/kie_10_1_0_release#advancing-rule-units" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advancing Rule Units" title="Direct link to Advancing Rule Units">​</a></h4>
<p>Rule Units remain targeted at greenfield projects and continue to evolve. These projects are better positioned to work around current limitations.</p>
<p>While RuleUnits provide a strong foundation, there are critical gaps that must be addressed before they can be considered a complete replacement for classic DRL. Examples include ambiguity in OOPath syntax, limited support for Decision Tables, and a lack of comprehensive test coverage.</p>
<p>Improvements are being investigated to simplify the use of OOPath in combination with accumulate and to improve the overall authoring experience.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rule-orchestration--startprocess">Rule Orchestration / startProcess<a href="https://kie.apache.org/blog/kie_10_1_0_release#rule-orchestration--startprocess" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rule Orchestration / startProcess" title="Direct link to Rule Orchestration / startProcess">​</a></h4>
<p>The startProcess() API has been deprecated since version 8.x and should not be called from client code, as doing so will result in a RuntimeException. Although the method still exists due to internal dependencies and because it is part of a shared interface with jBPM, it is no longer functional and is expected to be removed in a future version.
The recommended approach is to use the new code-generation-based process.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dmn-15-support">DMN 1.5 Support<a href="https://kie.apache.org/blog/kie_10_1_0_release#dmn-15-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DMN 1.5 Support" title="Direct link to DMN 1.5 Support">​</a></h4>
<p>Both the editor and engine now support the latest <strong>DMN 1.5</strong> specification.</p>

<p>Transitioning to the Apache Foundation was a monumental step for the KIE community, and the path to this release has been transformative. While the prolonged gap between releases posed challenges, it allowed us to focus on critical adjustments and improvements, paving the way for a stronger foundation. Here's an overview of the significant efforts that made this release possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive CI system overhaul to align with Apache standards.</li>
<li>Code adjustments for Apache policy compliance, including license reviews.</li>
<li>Fully reproducible builds for all .jar artifacts.</li>
<li>Remove cyclical dependencies and other technical debt.</li>
<li>Automate critical release processes to streamline future releases.</li>
<li>Java 17, Jakarta 10, Quarkus, and SpringBoot upgrades</li>
<li>And many more...</li>
</ul>
