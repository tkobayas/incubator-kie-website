<p>Transitioning to the Apache Foundation was a monumental step for the KIE community, and the path to this release has been transformative. While the prolonged gap between releases posed challenges, it allowed us to focus on critical adjustments and improvements, paving the way for a stronger foundation. Here's an overview of the significant efforts that made this release possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive CI system overhaul to align with Apache standards.</li>
<li>Code adjustments for Apache policy compliance, including license reviews.</li>
<li>Fully reproducible builds for all .jar artifacts.</li>
<li>Remove cyclical dependencies and other technical debt.</li>
<li>Automate critical release processes to streamline future releases.</li>
<li>Java 17, Jakarta 10, Quarkus, and SpringBoot upgrades</li>
<li>And many more...</li>
</ul>
